    <title>A Course in Miracles - Workbook</title>

        <title>Workbook for Students</title>
        <subtitle>Introduction</subtitle>
        <para>A theoretical foundation such as the text provides is necessary as a framework to make
            the exercises in this workbook meaningful. Yet it is doing the exercises that will make
            the goal of the course possible. An untrained mind can accomplish nothing. It is the
            purpose of this workbook to train your mind to think along the lines the text sets
            forth.</para>
        <para>The exercises are very simple. They do not require a great deal of time, and it does
            not matter where you do them. They need no preparation. The training period is one year.
            The exercises are numbered from 1 to 365. Do not undertake to do more than one set of
            exercises a day.</para>
        <para>The workbook is divided into two main sections, the first dealing with the undoing of
            the way you see now, and the second with the acquisition of true perception. With the
            exception of the review periods, each day's exercises are planned around one central
            idea, which is stated first. This is followed by a description of the specific
            procedures by which the idea for the day is to be applied.</para>
        <para>The purpose of the workbook is to train your mind in a systematic way to a different
            perception of everyone and everything in the world. The exercises are planned to help
            you generalize the lessons, so that you will understand that each of them is equally
            applicable to everyone and everything you see.</para>
        <para>Transfer of training in true perception does not proceed as does transfer of the
            training of the world. If true perception has been achieved in connection with any
            person, situation or event, total transfer to everyone and everything is certain. On the
            other hand, one exception held apart from true perception makes its accomplishments
            anywhere impossible.</para>
        <para>The only general rules to be observed throughout, then, are: First, that the exercises
            be practiced with great specificity, as will be indicated. This will help you to
            generalize the ideas involved to every situation in which you find yourself, and to
            everyone and everything in it. Second, be sure that you do not decide for yourself that
            there are some people, situations or things to which the ideas are inapplicable. This
            will interfere with transfer of training. The very nature of true perception is that it
            has no limits. It is the opposite of the way you see now.</para>
        <para>The overall aim of the exercises is to increase your ability to extend the ideas you
            will be practicing to include everything. This will require no effort on your part. The
            exercises themselves meet the conditions necessary for this kind of transfer.</para>
        <para>Some of the ideas the workbook presents you will find hard to believe, and others may
            seem to be quite startling. This does not matter. You are merely asked to apply the
            ideas as you are directed to do. You are not asked to judge them at all. You are asked
            only to use them. It is their use that will give them meaning to you, and will show you
            that they are true.</para>
        <para>Remember only this; you need not believe the ideas, you need not accept them, and you
            need not even welcome them. Some of them you may actively resist. None of this will
            matter, or decrease their efficacy. But do not allow yourself to make exceptions in
            applying the ideas the workbook contains, and whatever your reactions to the ideas may
            be, use them. Nothing more than that is required.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 1. Nothing I See Means Anything.</title>
                    <para>Nothing I see in this room [on this street, from this window, in this
                        place] means anything.</para>
                    <para>Now look slowly around you, and practice applying this idea very
                        specifically to whatever you see:</para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>This table does not mean
                            anything.</para>
                        <para>This chair does not mean
                            anything.</para>
                        <para>This hand does not mean
                            anything.</para>
                        <para>This foot does not mean
                            anything.</para>
                        <para>This pen does not mean
                            anything.</para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Then look farther away from your immediate area, and apply the idea to a
                        wider range:</para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>That door does not mean
                            anything.</para>
                        <para>That body does not mean
                            anything.</para>
                        <para>That lamp does not mean
                            anything.</para>
                        <para>That sign does not mean
                            anything.</para>
                        <para>That shadow does not mean
                            anything.</para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Notice that these statements are not arranged in any order, and make no
                        allowance for differences in the kinds of things to which they are applied.
                        That is the purpose of the exercise. The statement should merely be applied
                        to anything you see. As you practice the idea for the day, use it totally
                        indiscriminately. Do not attempt to apply it to everything you see, for
                        these exercises should not become ritualistic. Only be sure that nothing you
                        see is specifically excluded. One thing is like another as far as the
                        application of the idea is concerned.</para>
                    <para>Each of the first three lessons should not be done more than twice a day
                        each, preferably morning and evening. Nor should they be attempted for more
                        than a minute or so, unless that entails a sense of hurry. A comfortable
                        sense of leisure is essential.</para>

                <section xml:id="L002">
                    <title>Lesson 2. I have given everything I see all the meaning that it has for
                        me.</title>
                    <para>I have given everything I see in this room [on this street, from this
                        window, in this place] all the meaning that it has for me.</para>
                    <para>The exercises with this idea are the same as those for the first one.
                        Begin with the things that are near you, and apply the idea to whatever your
                        glance rests on. Then increase the range outward. Turn your head so that you
                        include whatever is on either side. If possible, turn around and apply the
                        idea to what was behind you. Remain as indiscriminate as possible in
                        selecting subjects for its application, do not concentrate on anything in
                        particular, and do not attempt to include everything you see in a given
                        area, or you will introduce strain.</para>
                    <para>Merely glance easily and fairly quickly around you, trying to avoid
                        selection by size, brightness, color, material, or relative importance to
                        you. Take the subjects simply as you see them. Try to apply the exercise
                        with equal ease to a body or a button, a fly or a floor, an arm or an apple.
                        The sole criterion for applying the idea to anything is merely that your
                        eyes have lighted on it. Make no attempt to include anything particular, but
                        be sure that nothing is specifically excluded.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 3. I do not understand anything I see.</title>
                    <para>I do not understand anything I see in this room [on this street, from this
                        window, in this place].</para>
                    <para>Apply this idea in the same way as the previous ones, without making
                        distinctions of any kind. Whatever you see becomes a proper subject for
                        applying the idea. Be sure that you do not question the suitability of
                        anything for application of the idea. These are not exercises in judgment.
                        Anything is suitable if you see it. Some of the things you see may have
                        emotionally charged meaning for you. Try to lay such feelings aside, and
                        merely use these things exactly as you would anything else.</para>
                    <para>The point of the exercises is to help you clear your mind of all past
                        associations, to see things exactly as they appear to you now, and to
                        realize how little you really understand about them. It is therefore
                        essential that you keep a perfectly open mind, unhampered by judgment, in
                        selecting the things to which the idea for the day is to be applied. For
                        this purpose one thing is like another; equally suitable and therefore
                        equally useful.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 4. These thoughts do not mean anything.</title>
                    <para>These thoughts do not mean anything. They are like the things I see in
                        this room [on this street, from this window, in this place].</para>
                    <para>Unlike the preceding ones, these exercises do not begin with the idea for
                        the day. In these practice periods, begin with noting the thoughts that are
                        crossing your mind for about a minute. Then apply the idea to them. If you
                        are already aware of unhappy thoughts, use them as subjects for the idea. Do
                        not, however, select only the thoughts you think are<quote> bad.</quote> You
                        will find, if you train yourself to look at your thoughts, that they
                        represent such a mixture that, in a sense, none of them can be called
                            <quote>good</quote> or <quote>bad.</quote> This is why they do not mean
                        anything.</para>
                    <para>In selecting the subjects for the application of today's idea, the usual
                        specificity is required. Do not be afraid to use <quote>good</quote>
                        thoughts as well as <quote>bad.</quote> None of them represents your real
                        thoughts, which are being covered up by them. The <quote>good</quote> ones
                        are but shadows of what lies beyond, and shadows make sight difficult. The
                            <quote>bad</quote> ones are blocks to sight, and make seeing impossible.
                        You do not want either.</para>
                    <para>This is a major exercise, and will be repeated from time to time in
                        somewhat different form. The aim here is to train you in the first steps
                        toward the goal of separating the meaningless from the meaningful. It is a
                        first attempt in the long-range purpose of learning to see the meaningless
                        as outside you, and the meaningful within. It is also the beginning of
                        training your mind to recognize what is the same and what is
                        different.</para>
                    <para>In using your thoughts for application of the idea for today, identify
                        each thought by the central figure or event it contains; for example:<blockquote>
                            <para>This thought about _______ does not mean
                                    anything.</para>
                            <para>It is like the things I see in this room
                                    [on this street, and so on].</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>You can also use the idea for a particular thought that you recognize as
                        harmful. This practice is useful, but is not a substitute for the more
                        random procedures to be followed for the exercises. Do not, however, examine
                        your mind for more than a minute or so. You are too inexperienced as yet to
                        avoid a tendency to become pointlessly preoccupied.</para>
                    <para>Further, since these exercises are the first of their kind, you may find
                        the suspension of judgment in connection with thoughts particularly
                        difficult. Do not repeat these exercises more than three or four times
                        during the day. We will return to them later.</para>
                </section>
                <section xml:id="L005">
                    <title>Lesson 5. I am never upset for the reason I think.</title>
                    <para>This idea, like the preceding one, can be used with any person, situation
                        or event you think is causing you pain. Apply it specifically to whatever
                        you believe is the cause of your upset, using the description of the feeling
                        in whatever term seems accurate to you. The upset may seem to be fear,
                        worry, depression, anxiety, anger, hatred, jealousy or any number of forms,
                        all of which will be perceived as different. This is not true. However,
                        until you learn that form does not matter, each form becomes a proper
                        subject for the exercises for the day. Applying the same idea to each of
                        them separately is the first step in ultimately recognizing they are all the
                        same.</para>
                    <para>When using the idea for today for a specific perceived cause of an upset
                        in any form, use both the name of the form in which you see the upset, and
                        the cause which you ascribe to it. For example:<blockquote>
                            <para>I am not angry at ______ for the reason I
                                    think.</para>
                            <para>I am not afraid of ______ for the reason I
                                    think.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>But again, this should not be substituted for practice periods in which
                        you first search your mind for <quote>sources</quote> of upset in which you
                        believe, and forms of upset which you think result.</para>
                    <para>In these exercises, more than in the preceding ones, you may find it hard
                        to be indiscriminate, and to avoid giving greater weight to some subjects
                        than to others. It might help to precede the exercises with the statement:<blockquote>
                            <para>There are no small upsets. They are all
                                    equally disturbing to my peace of mind.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>Then examine your mind for whatever is distressing you, regardless of how
                        much or how little you think it is doing so.</para>
                    <para>You may also find yourself less willing to apply today's idea to some
                        perceived sources of upset than to others. If this occurs, think first of this:<blockquote>
                            <para>I cannot keep this form of upset and let
                                    the others go.</para>
                            <para>For the purposes of these exercises,
                                    then,</para>
                            <para>I will regard them all as the
                                    same.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>Then search your mind for no more than a minute or so, and try to identify
                        a number of different forms of upset that are disturbing you, regardless of
                        the relative importance you may give them. Apply the idea for today to each
                        of them, using the name of both the source of the upset as you perceive it,
                        and of the feeling as you experience it. Further examples are:<blockquote>
                            <para>I am not worried about ______ for the
                                    reason I think.</para>

                    <para>The exercises with this idea are very similar to the preceding ones.
                        Again, it is necessary to name both the form of upset (anger, fear, worry,
                        depression and so on) and the perceived source very specifically for any
                        application of the idea. For example:<blockquote>
                            <para>I am angry at ______ because I see
                                    something that is not there.</para>
                            <para>I am worried about ______ because I see
                                    something that is not there.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>Today's idea is useful for application to anything that seems to upset
                        you, and can profitably be used throughout the day for that purpose.
                        However, the three or four practice periods which are required should be
                        preceded by a minute or so of mind searching, as before, and the application
                        of the idea to each upsetting thought uncovered in the search.</para>
                    <para>Again, if you resist applying the idea to some upsetting thoughts more
                        than to others, remind yourself of the two cautions stated in the previous lesson:<blockquote>
                            <para>There are no small upsets. They are all
                                    equally disturbing to my peace of mind.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>And:<blockquote>

                                    the others go.</para>
                            <para>For the purposes of these exercises,
                                    then,</para>

                    <para>Old ideas about time are very difficult to change, because everything you

                        about it. Yet that is precisely why you need new ideas about time. This
                        first time idea is not really so strange as it may sound at first.</para>
                    <para>Look at a cup, for example. Do you see a cup, or are you merely reviewing
                        your past experiences of picking up a cup, being thirsty, drinking from a
                        cup, feeling the rim of a cup against your lips, having breakfast and so on?
                        Are not your aesthetic reactions to the cup, too, based on past experiences?
                        How else would you know whether or not this kind of cup will break if you
                        drop it? What do you know about this cup except what you learned in the
                        past? You would have no idea what this cup is, except for your past
                        learning. Do you, then, really see it?</para>
                    <para>Look about you. This is equally true of whatever you look at. Acknowledge
                        this by applying the idea for today indiscriminately to whatever catches
                        your eye. For example:<blockquote>
                            <para>I see only the past in this
                                    pencil.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 8. My mind is preoccupied with past thoughts.</title>
                    <para>This idea is, of course, the reason why you see only the past. No one
                        really sees anything. He sees only his thoughts projected outward. The
                        mind's preoccupation with the past is the cause of the misconception about
                        time from which your seeing suffers. Your mind cannot grasp the present,
                        which is the only time there is. It therefore cannot understand time, and
                        cannot, in fact, understand anything.</para>
                    <para>The one wholly true thought one can hold about the past is that it is not
                        here. To think about it at all is therefore to think about illusions. Very
                        few have realized what is actually entailed in picturing the past or in
                        anticipating the future. The mind is actually blank when it does this,
                        because it is not really thinking about anything.</para>
                    <para>The purpose of the exercises for today is to begin to train your mind to
                        recognize when it is not really thinking at all. While thoughtless ideas
                        preoccupy your mind, the truth is blocked. Recognizing that your mind has
                        been merely blank, rather than believing that it is filled with real ideas,
                        is the first step to opening the way to vision.</para>
                    <para>The exercises for today should be done with eyes closed. This is because
                        you actually cannot see anything, and it is easier to recognize that no
                        matter how vividly you may picture a thought, you are not seeing anything.
                        With as little investment as possible, search your mind for the usual minute
                        or so, merely noting the thoughts you find there. Name each one by the
                        central figure or theme it contains, and pass on to the next. Introduce the
                        practice period by saying:<blockquote>
                            <para>I seem to be thinking about
                                    ______.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>Then name each of your thoughts specifically, for example:<blockquote>
                            <para>I seem to be thinking about [name of a
                                    person], about [name of an object], about [name of an
                                    emotion],</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>and so on, concluding at the end of the mind-searching period with:<blockquote>
                            <para>But my mind is preoccupied with past
                                    thoughts.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>This can be done four or five times during the day, unless you find it
                        irritates you. If you find it trying, three or four times is sufficient. You
                        might find it helpful, however, to include your irritation, or any emotion
                        that the idea for today may induce, in the mind searching itself.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 9. I see nothing as it is now.</title>
                    <para>This idea obviously follows from the two preceding ones. But while you may
                        be able to accept it intellectually, it is unlikely that it will mean
                        anything to you as yet. However, understanding is not necessary at this
                        point. In fact, the recognition that you do not understand is a prerequisite
                        for undoing your false ideas. These exercises are concerned with practice,
                        not with understanding. You do not need to practice what you already
                        understand. It would indeed be circular to aim at understanding, and assume
                        that you have it already.</para>
                    <para>It is difficult for the untrained mind to believe that what it seems to
                        picture is not there. This idea can be quite disturbing, and may meet with
                        active resistance in any number of forms. Yet that does not preclude
                        applying it. No more than that is required for these or any other exercises.
                        Each small step will clear a little of the darkness away, and understanding
                        will finally come to lighten every corner of the mind that has been cleared
                        of the debris that darkens it.</para>
                    <para>These exercises, for which three or four practice periods are sufficient,
                        involve looking about you and applying the idea for the day to whatever you
                        see, remembering the need for its indiscriminate application, and the
                        essential rule of excluding nothing. For example:<blockquote>
                            <para>I do not see this computer as it is
                                    now.</para>

                            <para>I do not see this arm as it is

                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>Begin with things that are nearest you, and then extend the range outward:<blockquote>
                            <para>I do not see that coat rack as it is
                                    now.</para>
                            <para>I do not see that door as it is

                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>It is emphasized again that while complete inclusion should not be
                        attempted, specific exclusion must be avoided. Be sure you are honest with
                        yourself in making this distinction. You may be tempted to obscure
                        it.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 10. My thoughts do not mean anything.</title>
                    <para>This idea applies to all the thoughts of which you are aware, or become
                        aware in the practice periods. The reason the idea is applicable to all of
                        them is that they are not your real thoughts. We have made this distinction
                        before, and will do so again. You have no basis for comparison as yet. When
                        you do, you will have no doubt that what you once believed were your
                        thoughts did not mean anything.</para>
                    <para>This is the second time we have used this kind of idea. The form is only
                        slightly different. This time the idea is introduced with "My thoughts"
                        instead of "These thoughts," and no link is made overtly with the things
                        around you. The emphasis is now on the lack of reality of what you think you
                        think.</para>
                    <para>This aspect of the correction process began with the idea that the
                        thoughts of which you are aware are meaningless, outside rather than within;
                        and then stressed their past rather than their present status. Now we are
                        emphasizing that the presence of these "thoughts" means that you are not
                        thinking. This is merely another way of repeating our earlier statement that
                        your mind is really a blank. To recognize this is to recognize nothingness
                        when you think you see it. As such, it is the prerequisite for
                        vision.</para>
                    <para>Close your eyes for these exercises, and introduce them by repeating the
                        idea for today quite slowly to yourself. Then add:<blockquote>
                            <para>This idea will help to release me from all
                                    that I now believe.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>The exercises consist, as before, in searching your mind for all the
                        thoughts that are available to you, without selection or judgment. Try to
                        avoid classification of any kind. In fact, if you find it helpful to do so,
                        you might imagine that you are watching an oddly assorted procession going
                        by, which has little if any personal meaning to you. As each one crosses
                        your mind, say:<blockquote>
                            <para>My thought about ______ does not mean
                                    anything.</para>
                            <para>My thought about ______ does not mean
                                    anything.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>Today's thought can obviously serve for any thought that distresses you at
                        any time. In addition, five practice periods are recommended, each involving
                        no more than a minute or so of mind searching. It is not recommended that
                        this time period be extended, and it should be reduced to half a minute or
                        less if you experience discomfort. Remember, however, to repeat the idea
                        slowly before applying it specifically, and also to add:<blockquote>
                            <para>This idea will help to release me from all
                                    that I now believe.</para>

                        if the world determines what you perceive. Today's idea introduces the
                        concept that your thoughts determine the world you see. Be glad indeed to
                        practice the idea in its initial form, for in this idea is your release made
                        sure. The key to forgiveness lies in it.</para>
                    <para>The practice periods for today's idea are to be undertaken somewhat
                        differently from the previous ones. Begin with your eyes closed, and repeat
                        the idea slowly to yourself. Then open your eyes and look about, near and
                        far, up and down,--anywhere. During the minute or so to be spent in using
                        the idea merely repeat it to yourself, being sure to do so without haste,
                        and with no sense of urgency or effort.</para>
                    <para>To do these exercises for maximum benefit, the eyes should move from one
                        thing to another fairly rapidly, since they should not linger on anything in
                        particular. The words, however, should be used in an unhurried, even
                        leisurely fashion. The introduction to this idea, in particular, should be
                        practiced as casually as possible. It contains the foundation for the peace,
                        relaxation and freedom from worry that we are trying to achieve. On
                        concluding the exercises, close your eyes and repeat the idea once more
                        slowly to yourself.</para>
                    <para>Three practice periods today will probably be sufficient. However, if
                        there is little or no uneasiness and an inclination to do more, as many as
                        five may be undertaken. More than this is not recommended.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 12. I am upset because I see a meaningless world.</title>
                    <para>The importance of this idea lies in the fact that it contains a correction
                        for a major perceptual distortion. You think that what upsets you is a
                        frightening world, or a sad world, or a violent world, or an insane world.
                        All these attributes are given it by you. The world is meaningless in
                        itself.</para>
                    <para>These exercises are done with eyes open. Look around you, this time quite
                        slowly. Try to pace yourself so that the slow shifting of your glance from
                        one thing to another involves a fairly constant time interval. Do not allow
                        the time of the shift to become markedly longer or shorter, but try,
                        instead, to keep a measured, even tempo throughout. What you see does not
                        matter. You teach yourself this as you give whatever your glance rests on
                        equal attention and equal time. This is a beginning step in learning to give
                        them all equal value.</para>
                    <para>As you look about you, say to yourself:</para><blockquote>
                            <para>I think I see a fearful world, a dangerous
                                    world,</para>
                            <para>. . . a hostile world,</para>
                            <para>. . . a sad world,</para>
                            <para>. . . a wicked world,</para>
                            <para>. . . a crazy world,</para>
                        </blockquote>
                    <para>. . . and so on, using whatever descriptive terms happen to occur to you.
                        If terms which seem positive rather than negative occur to you, include
                        them. For example, you might think of <quote>a good world, </quote>or
                            <quote>a satisfying world.</quote> If such terms occur to you, use them
                        along with the rest. You may not yet understand why these
                            <quote>nice</quote> adjectives belong in these exercises but remember
                        that a <quote>good world</quote> implies a <quote>bad</quote> one, and a
                            <quote>satisfying world</quote> implies an <quote>unsatisfying</quote>
                        one. All terms which cross your mind are suitable subjects for today's
                        exercises. Their seeming quality does not matter.</para>
                    <para>Be sure that you do not alter the time intervals between applying today's
                        idea to what you think is pleasant and what you think is unpleasant. For the
                        purposes of these exercises, there is no difference between them. At the end
                        of the practice period, add:<blockquote>
                            <para>But I am upset because I see a meaningless
                                    world.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>What is meaningless is neither good nor bad. Why, then, should a
                        meaningless world upset you? If you could accept the world as meaningless
                        and let the truth be written upon it for you, it would make you
                        indescribably happy. But because it is meaningless, you are impelled to
                        write upon it what you would have it be. It is this you see in it. It is
                        this that is meaningless in truth. Beneath your words is written the Word of
                        God. The truth upsets you now, but when your words have been erased, you
                        will see His. That is the ultimate purpose of these exercises.</para>
                    <para>Three or four times is enough for practicing the idea for today. Nor
                        should the practice periods exceed a minute. You may find even this too
                        long. Terminate the exercises whenever you experience a sense of
                        strain.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 13. A meaningless world engenders fear.</title>
                    <para>Today's idea is really another form of the preceding one, except that it
                        is more specific as to the emotion aroused. Actually, a meaningless world is
                        impossible. Nothing without meaning exists. However, it does not follow that
                        you will not think you perceive something that has no meaning. On the
                        contrary, you will be particularly likely to think you do perceive
                        it.</para>
                    <para>Recognition of meaninglessness arouses intense anxiety in all the
                        separated ones. It represents a situation in which God and the ego
                        "challenge" each other as to whose meaning is to be written in the empty
                        space that meaninglessness provides. The ego rushes in frantically to
                        establish its own ideas there, fearful that the void may otherwise be used
                        to demonstrate its own impotence and unreality. And on this alone it is
                        correct.</para>
                    <para>It is essential, therefore, that you learn to recognize the meaningless,
                        and accept it without fear. If you are fearful, it is certain that you will
                        endow the world with attributes that it does not possess, and crowd it with
                        images that do not exist. To the ego illusions are safety devices, as they
                        must also be to you who equate yourself with the ego.</para>
                    <para>The exercises for today, which should be done about three or four times
                        for not more than a minute or so at most each time, are to be practiced in a
                        somewhat different way from the preceding ones. With eyes closed, repeat
                        today's idea to yourself. Then open your eyes, and look about you slowly, saying:</para><blockquote>
                            <para>I am looking at a meaningless
                                    world.</para>
                        </blockquote>
                    <para>Repeat this statement to yourself as you look about. Then close your eyes,
                        and conclude with:</para><blockquote>
                            <para>A meaningless world engenders
                                    fear</para>
                            <para>because I think I am in competition with
                                    God.</para>
                        </blockquote>
                    <para>You may find it difficult to avoid resistance, in one form or another, to
                        this concluding statement. Whatever form such resistance may take, remind
                        yourself that you are really afraid of such a thought because of the
                            <quote>vengeance</quote> of the <quote>enemy.</quote> You are not
                        expected to believe the statement at this point, and will probably dismiss
                        it as preposterous. Note carefully, however, any signs of overt or covert
                        fear which it may arouse.</para>
                    <para>This is our first attempt at stating an explicit cause and effect
                        relationship of a kind which you are very inexperienced in recognizing. Do
                        not dwell on the concluding statement, and try not even to think of it
                        except during the practice periods. That will suffice at present.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 14. God did not create a meaningless world.</title>
                    <para>The idea for today is, of course, the reason why a meaningless world is
                        impossible. What God did not create does not exist. And everything that does
                        exist exists as He created it. The world you see has nothing to do with
                        reality. It is of your own making, and it does not exist.</para>
                    <para>The exercises for today are to be practiced with eyes closed throughout.
                        The mind-searching period should be short, a minute at most. Do not have
                        more than three practice periods with today's idea unless you find them
                        comfortable. If you do, it will be because you really understand what they
                        are for.</para>
                    <para>The idea for today is another step in learning to let go the thoughts that
                        you have written on the world, and see the Word of God in their place. The
                        early steps in this exchange, which can truly be called salvation, can be
                        quite difficult and even quite painful. Some of them will lead you directly
                        into fear. You will not be left there. You will go far beyond it. Our
                        direction is toward perfect safety and perfect peace.</para>
                    <para>With eyes closed, think of all the horrors in the world that cross your
                        mind. Name each one as it occurs to you, and then deny its reality. God did
                        not create it, and so it is not real. Say, for example:<blockquote>
                            <para>God did not create that war, and so it is
                                    not real.</para>
                            <para>God did not create that airplane crash,
                                    and so it is not real.</para>
                            <para>God did not create that disaster
                                    [specify], and so it is not real.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>Suitable subjects for the application of today's idea also include
                        anything you are afraid might happen to you, or to anyone about whom you are
                        concerned. In each case, name the "disaster" quite specifically. Do not use
                        general terms. For example, do not say, "God did not create illness," but,
                        "God did not create cancer," or heart attacks, or whatever may arouse fear
                        in you.</para>
                    <para>This is your personal repertory of horrors at which you are looking. These
                        things are part of the world you see. Some of them are shared illusions, and
                        others are part of your personal hell. It does not matter. What God did not
                        create can only be in your own mind apart from His. Therefore, it has no
                        meaning. In recognition of this fact, conclude the practice periods by
                        repeating today's idea:<blockquote>
                            <para>God did not create a meaningless

                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>The idea for today can, of course, be applied to anything that disturbs
                        you during the day, aside from the practice periods. Be very specific in
                        applying it. Say:<blockquote>
                            <para>God did not create a meaningless
                                    world.</para>

                            <para>and so it is not real.</para>

                    <para>It is because the thoughts you think you think appear as images that you
                        do not recognize them as nothing. You think you think them, and so you think
                        you see them. This is how your "seeing" was made. This is the function you
                        have given your body's eyes. It is not seeing. It is image making. It takes
                        the place of seeing, replacing vision with illusions.</para>
                    <para>This introductory idea to the process of image making that you call seeing
                        will not have much meaning for you. You will begin to understand it when you
                        have seen little edges of light around the same familiar objects which you
                        see now. That is the beginning of real vision. You can be certain that real
                        vision will come quickly when this has occurred.</para>

                        application of today's idea. It is necessary, however, to continue to look
                        at each subject while you repeat the idea to yourself. The idea should be
                        repeated quite slowly each time.</para>

                        the selection as random as possible. Less than a minute will do for the
                        practice periods, if you begin to feel uneasy. Do not have more than three
                        application periods for today's idea unless you feel completely comfortable
                        with it, and do not exceed four. However, the idea can be applied as needed

                    <title>Lesson 16. I have no neutral thoughts.</title>
                    <para>The idea for today is a beginning step in dispelling the belief that your
                        thoughts have no effect. Everything you see is the result of your thoughts.
                        There is no exception to this fact. Thoughts are not big or little; powerful
                        or weak. They are merely true or false. Those that are true create their own
                        likeness. Those that are false make theirs.</para>
                    <para>There is no more self-contradictory concept than that of "idle thoughts."
                        What gives rise to the perception of a whole world can hardly be called
                        idle. Every thought you have contributes to truth or to illusion; either it
                        extends the truth or it multiplies illusions. You can indeed multiply
                        nothing, but you will not extend it by doing so.</para>
                    <para>Besides your recognizing that thoughts are never idle, salvation requires
                        that you also recognize that every thought you have brings either peace or
                        war; either love or fear. A neutral result is impossible because a neutral
                        thought is impossible. There is such a temptation to dismiss fear thoughts
                        as unimportant, trivial and not worth bothering about that it is essential
                        you recognize them all as equally destructive, but equally unreal. We will
                        practice this idea in many forms before you really understand it.</para>
                    <para>In applying the idea for today, search your mind for a minute or so with
                        eyes closed, and actively seek not to overlook any "little" thought that may
                        tend to elude the search. This is quite difficult until you get used to it.
                        You will find that it is still hard for you not to make artificial
                        distinctions. Every thought that occurs to you, regardless of the qualities
                        that you assign to it, is a suitable subject for applying today's
                        idea.</para>
                    <para>In the practice periods, first repeat the idea to yourself, and then as
                        each one crosses your mind hold it in awareness while you tell yourself:<blockquote>
                            <para>This thought about ______ is not a neutral
                                    thought.</para>
                            <para>That thought about ______ is not a neutral
                                    thought.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>As usual, use today's idea whenever you are aware of a particular thought
                        that arouses uneasiness. The following form is suggested for this purpose:<blockquote>
                            <para>This thought about ______ is not a neutral
                                    thought,</para>
                            <para>because I have no neutral
                                    thoughts.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>Four or five practice periods are recommended, if you find them relatively
                        effortless. If strain is experienced, three will be enough. The length of
                        the exercise period should also be reduced if there is discomfort.</para>

                <section xml:id="L017">
                    <title>Lesson 17. I see no neutral things.</title>
                    <para>This idea is another step in the direction of identifying cause and effect
                        as it really operates in the world. You see no neutral things because you
                        have no neutral thoughts. It is always the thought that comes first, despite
                        the temptation to believe that it is the other way around. This is not the
                        way the world thinks, but you must learn that it is the way you think. If it
                        were not so, perception would have no cause, and would itself be the cause
                        of reality. In view of its highly variable nature, this is hardly
                        likely.</para>
                    <para>In applying today's idea, say to yourself, with eyes open:<blockquote>
                            <para>I see no neutral things
                                because</para>
                            <para>I have no neutral
                                thoughts.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>Then look about you, resting your glance on each thing you note long
                        enough to say:<blockquote>
                            <para>I do not see a neutral ______
                                    because</para>
                            <para>my thoughts about ______ are not
                                    neutral.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>For example, you might say:<blockquote>
                            <para>I do not see a neutral wall,
                                    because</para>
                            <para>my thoughts about walls are not
                                    neutral.</para>
                            <para/>
                            <para>I do not see a neutral body,
                                    because</para>
                            <para>my thoughts about bodies are not
                                    neutral.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>As usual, it is essential to make no distinctions between what you believe
                        to be animate or inanimate; pleasant or unpleasant. Regardless of what you
                        may believe, you do not see anything that is really alive or really joyous.
                        That is because you are unaware as yet of any thought that is really true,
                        and therefore really happy.</para>
                    <para>Three or four specific practice periods are recommended, and no less than
                        three are required for maximum benefit, even if you experience resistance.
                        However, if you do, the length of the practice period may be reduced to less
                        than the minute or so that is otherwise recommended.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 18. I am not alone in experiencing the effects of my
                        seeing.</title>
                    <para>The idea for today is another step in learning that the thoughts which
                        give rise to what you see are never neutral or unimportant. It also
                        emphasizes the idea that minds are joined, which will be given increasing
                        stress later on.</para>
                    <para>Today's idea does not refer to what you see as much as to how you see it.
                        Therefore, the exercises for today emphasize this aspect of your perception.
                        The three or four practice periods which are recommended should be done as
                        follows:</para>
                    <para>Look about you, selecting subjects for the application of the idea for
                        today as randomly as possible, and keeping your eyes on each one long enough
                        to say:</para>
                    <para>
                        <blockquote>
                            <para>I am not alone in                                experiencing</para>
                            <para>the effects of how I see ______                                    .</para>
                        </blockquote>
                    </para>
                    <para>Conclude each practice period by repeating the more general statement:<blockquote>
                            <para>I am not alone in                                experiencing</para>

                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>A minute or so, or even less, will be sufficient for each practice
                        period.</para>
                </section>
                <section xml:id="L019">
                    <title>Lesson 19. I am not alone in experiencing the effects of my
                        thoughts.</title>
                    <para>The idea for today is obviously the reason why your seeing does not affect
                        you alone. You will notice that at times the ideas related to thinking
                        precede those related to perceiving, while at other times the order is
                        reversed. The reason is that the order does not matter. Thinking and its
                        results are really simultaneous, for cause and effect are never
                        separate.</para>
                    <para>Today we are again emphasizing the fact that minds are joined. This is
                        rarely a wholly welcome idea at first, since it seems to carry with it an
                        enormous sense of responsibility, and may even be regarded as an "invasion
                        of privacy." Yet it is a fact that there are no private thoughts. Despite
                        your initial resistance to this idea, you will yet understand that it must
                        be true if salvation is possible at all. And salvation must be possible
                        because it is the Will of God.</para>
                    <para>The minute or so of mind searching which today's exercises require is to
                        be undertaken with eyes closed. The idea for today is to be repeated first,
                        and then the mind should be carefully searched for the thoughts it contains
                        at that time. As you consider each one, name it in terms of the central
                        person or theme it contains, and holding it in your mind as you do so, say:<blockquote>
                            <para>I am not alone in                                experiencing</para>
                            <para>the effects of this thought about ______                                    .</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>The requirement of as much indiscriminateness as possible in selecting
                        subjects for the practice periods should be quite familiar to you by now,
                        and will no longer be repeated each day, although it will occasionally be
                        included as a reminder. Do not forget, however, that random selection of
                        subjects for all practice periods remains essential throughout. Lack of
                        order in this connection will ultimately make the recognition of lack of
                        order in miracles meaningful to you.</para>
                    <para>Apart from the <quote>as needed</quote> application of today's idea, at
                        least three practice periods are required, shortening the length of time
                        involved, if necessary. Do not attempt more than four.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 20. I am determined to see.</title>
                    <para>We have been quite casual about our practice periods thus far. There has
                        been virtually no attempt to direct the time for undertaking them, minimal
                        effort has been required, and not even active cooperation and interest have
                        been asked. This approach has been intentional, and very carefully planned.
                        We have not lost sight of the crucial importance of the reversal of your
                        thinking. The salvation of the world depends on it. Yet you will not see if
                        you regard yourself as being coerced, and if you give in to resentment and
                        opposition.</para>
                    <para>This is our first attempt to introduce structure. Do not misconstrue it as
                        an effort to exert force or pressure. You want salvation. You want to be
                        happy. You want peace. You do not have them now, because your mind is
                        totally undisciplined, and you cannot distinguish between joy and sorrow,
                        pleasure and pain, love and fear. You are now learning how to tell them
                        apart. And great indeed will be your reward.</para>
                    <para>Your decision to see is all that vision requires. What you want is yours.
                        Do not mistake the little effort that is asked of you for an indication that
                        our goal is of little worth. Can the salvation of the world be a trivial
                        purpose? And can the world be saved if you are not? God has one Son, and he
                        is the resurrection and the life. His will is done because all power is
                        given him in Heaven and on earth. In your determination to see is vision
                        given you.</para>
                    <para>The exercises for today consist in reminding yourself throughout the day
                        that you want to see. Today's idea also tacitly implies the recognition that
                        you do not see now. Therefore, as you repeat the idea, you are stating that
                        you are determined to change your present state for a better one, and one
                        you really want.</para>
                    <para>Repeat today's idea slowly and positively at least twice an hour today,
                        attempting to do so every half hour. Do not be distressed if you forget to
                        do so, but make a real effort to remember. The extra repetitions should be
                        applied to any situation, person or event that upsets you. You can see them
                        differently, and you will. What you desire you will see. Such is the real
                        law of cause and effect as it operates in the world.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 21. I am determined to see things differently.</title>
                    <para>The idea for today is obviously a continuation and extension of the
                        preceding one. This time, however, specific mind-searching periods are
                        necessary, in addition to applying the idea to particular situations as they
                        may arise. Five practice periods are urged, allowing a full minute for
                        each.</para>
                    <para>In the practice periods, begin by repeating the idea to yourself. Then
                        close your eyes and search your mind carefully for situations past, present
                        or anticipated that arouse anger in you. The anger may take the form of any
                        reaction ranging from mild irritation to rage. The degree of the emotion you
                        experience does not matter. You will become increasingly aware that a slight
                        twinge of annoyance is nothing but a veil drawn over intense fury.</para>
                    <para>Try, therefore, not to let the "little" thoughts of anger escape you in
                        the practice periods. Remember that you do not really recognize what arouses
                        anger in you, and nothing that you believe in this connection means
                        anything. You will probably be tempted to dwell more on some situations or
                        persons than on others, on the fallacious grounds that they are more
                        "obvious." This is not so. It is merely an example of the belief that some
                        forms of attack are more justified than others.</para>
                    <para>As you search your mind for all the forms in which attack thoughts present
                        themselves, hold each one in mind while you tell yourself:<blockquote>
                            <para>I am determined to see ______ [name of                                    person] differently.</para>
                            <para>I am determined to see ______ [specify the                                    situation] differently.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>Try to be as specific as possible. You may, for example, focus your anger
                        on a particular attribute of a particular person, believing that the anger
                        is limited to this aspect. If your perception is suffering from this form of
                        distortion, say:<blockquote>

                    <para>Today's idea accurately describes the way anyone who holds attack thoughts
                        in his mind must see the world. Having projected his anger onto the world,
                        he sees vengeance about to strike at him. His own attack is thus perceived
                        as self defense. This becomes an increasingly vicious circle until he is
                        willing to change how he sees. Otherwise, thoughts of attack and
                        counter-attack will preoccupy him and people his entire world. What peace of
                        mind is possible to him then?</para>
                    <para>It is from this savage fantasy that you want to escape. Is it not joyous
                        news to hear that it is not real? Is it not a happy discovery to find that
                        you can escape? You made what you would destroy; everything that you hate
                        and would attack and kill. All that you fear does not exist.</para>
                    <para>Look at the world about you at least five times today, for at least a
                        minute each time. As your eyes move slowly from one object to another, from

                    <title>Lesson 23. I can escape from the world I see by giving up attack
                        thoughts.</title>
                    <para>The idea for today contains the only way out of fear that will ever
                        succeed. Nothing else will work; everything else is meaningless. But this
                        way cannot fail. Every thought you have makes up some segment of the world
                        you see. It is with your thoughts, then, that we must work, if your
                        perception of the world is to be changed.</para>
                    <para>If the cause of the world you see is attack thoughts, you must learn that
                        it is these thoughts which you do not want. There is no point in lamenting
                        the world. There is no point in trying to change the world. It is incapable
                        of change because it is merely an effect. But there is indeed a point in
                        changing your thoughts about the world. Here you are changing the cause. The
                        effect will change automatically.</para>
                    <para>The world you see is a vengeful world, and everything in it is a symbol of
                        vengeance. Each of your perceptions of "external reality" is a pictorial
                        representation of your own attack thoughts. One can well ask if this can be
                        called seeing. Is not fantasy a better word for such a process, and
                        hallucination a more appropriate term for the result?</para>
                    <para>You see the world that you have made, but you do not see yourself as the
                        image maker. You cannot be saved from the world, but you can escape from its
                        cause. This is what salvation means, for where is the world you see when its
                        cause is gone? Vision already holds a replacement for everything you think
                        you see now. Loveliness can light your images, and so transform them that
                        you will love them, even though they were made of hate. For you will not be
                        making them alone.</para>
                    <para>The idea for today introduces the thought that you are not trapped in the
                        world you see, because its cause can be changed. This change requires,
                        first, that the cause be identified and then let go, so that it can be
                        replaced. The first two steps in this process require your cooperation. The
                        final one does not. Your images have already been replaced. By taking the
                        first two steps, you will see that this is so.</para>
                    <para>Besides using it throughout the day as the need arises, five practice
                        periods are required in applying today's idea. As you look about you, repeat
                        the idea slowly to yourself first, and then close your eyes and devote about
                        a minute to searching your mind for as many attack thoughts as occur to you.
                        As each one crosses your mind say:<blockquote>
                            <para>I can escape from the world I                                    see</para>
                            <para>by giving up attack thoughts about                                    ______.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>Hold each attack thought in mind as you say this, and then dismiss that
                        thought and go on to the next.</para>
                    <para>In the practice periods, be sure to include both your thoughts of
                        attacking and of being attacked. Their effects are exactly the same because
                        they are exactly the same. You do not recognize this as yet, and you are
                        asked at this time only to treat them as the same in today's practice
                        periods. We are still at the stage of identifying the cause of the world you
                        see. When you finally learn that thoughts of attack and of being attacked
                        are not different, you will be ready to let the cause go.</para>

                    <para>In no situation that arises do you realize the outcome that would make you
                        happy. Therefore, you have no guide to appropriate action, and no way of
                        judging the result. What you do is determined by your perception of the
                        situation, and that perception is wrong. It is inevitable, then, that you
                        will not serve your own best interests. Yet they are your only goal in any
                        situation which is correctly perceived. Otherwise, you will not recognize
                        what they are.</para>
                    <para>If you realized that you do not perceive your own best interests, you
                        could be taught what they are. But in the presence of your conviction that
                        you do know what they are, you cannot learn. The idea for today is a step
                        toward opening your mind so that learning can begin.</para>
                    <para>The exercises for today require much more honesty than you are accustomed
                        to using. A few subjects, honestly and carefully considered in each of the
                        five practice periods which should be undertaken today, will be more helpful
                        than a more cursory examination of a large number. Two minutes are suggested
                        for each of the mind-searching periods which the exercises involve.</para>
                    <para>The practice periods should begin with repeating today's idea, followed by
                        searching the mind, with closed eyes, for unresolved situations about which
                        you are currently concerned. The emphasis should be on uncovering the
                        outcome you want. You will quickly realize that you have a number of goals
                        in mind as part of the desired outcome, and also that these goals are on
                        different levels and often conflict.</para>
                    <para>In applying the idea for today, name each situation that occurs to you,
                        and then enumerate carefully as many goals as possible that you would like
                        to be met in its resolution. The form of each application should be roughly
                        as follows:<blockquote>
                            <para>In the situation involving ______, I would                                    like ______</para>
                            <para>to happen, and ______ to                                    happen,</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>. . . .and so on. Try to cover as many different kinds of outcomes as may
                        honestly occur to you, even if some of them do not appear to be directly
                        related to the situation, or even to be inherent in it at all.</para>
                    <para>If these exercises are done properly, you will quickly recognize that you
                        are making a large number of demands of the situation which have nothing to
                        do with it. You will also recognize that many of your goals are
                        contradictory, that you have no unified outcome in mind, and that you must
                        experience disappointment in connection with some of your goals, however the
                        situation turns out.</para>
                    <para>After covering the list of as many hoped-for goals as possible, for each
                        unresolved situation that crosses your mind say to yourself:<blockquote>

                    <title>Lesson 25. I do not know what anything is for.</title>
                    <para>Purpose is meaning. Today's idea explains why nothing you see means
                        anything. You do not know what it is for. Therefore, it is meaningless to
                        you. Everything is for your own best interests. That is what it is for; that
                        is its purpose; that is what it means. It is in recognizing this that your
                        goals become unified. It is in recognizing this that what you see is given
                        meaning.</para>
                    <para>You perceive the world and everything in it as meaningful in terms of ego
                        goals. These goals have nothing to do with your own best interests, because
                        the ego is not you. This false identification makes you incapable of
                        understanding what anything is for. As a result, you are bound to misuse it.
                        When you believe this, you will try to withdraw the goals you have assigned
                        to the world, instead of attempting to reinforce them.</para>
                    <para>Another way of describing the goals you now perceive is to say that they
                        are all concerned with "personal" interests. Since you have no personal
                        interests, your goals are really concerned with nothing. In cherishing them,
                        therefore, you have no goals at all. And thus you do not know what anything
                        is for.</para>
                    <para>Before you can make any sense out of the exercises for today, one more
                        thought is necessary. At the most superficial levels, you do recognize
                        purpose. Yet purpose cannot be understood at these levels. For example, you
                        do understand that a telephone is for the purpose of talking to someone who
                        is not physically in your immediate vicinity. What you do not understand is
                        what you want to reach him for. And it is this that makes your contact with
                        him meaningful or not.</para>
                    <para>It is crucial to your learning to be willing to give up the goals you have
                        established for everything. The recognition that they are meaningless,
                        rather than "good" or "bad," is the only way to accomplish this. The idea
                        for today is a step in this direction.</para>
                    <para>Six practice periods, each of two-minutes duration, are required. Each
                        practice period should begin with a slow repetition of the idea for today,
                        followed by looking about you and letting your glance rest on whatever
                        happens to catch your eye, near or far, <quote>important</quote> or
                            <quote>unimportant,</quote>
                        <quote>human</quote> or <quote>nonhuman.</quote> With your eyes resting on
                        each subject you so select, say, for example:<blockquote>
                            <para>I do not know what this chair is                                    for.</para>
                            <para>I do not know what this pencil is                                    for.</para>
                            <para>I do not know what this hand is                                    for.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>Say this quite slowly, without shifting your eyes from the subject until
                        you have completed the statement about it. Then move on to the next subject,
                        and apply today's idea as before.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 26. My attack thoughts are attacking my invulnerability.</title>
                    <para>It is surely obvious that if you can be attacked you are not invulnerable.
                        You see attack as a real threat. That is because you believe that you can
                        really attack. And what would have effects through you must also have
                        effects on you. It is this law that will ultimately save you, but you are
                        misusing it now. You must therefore learn how it can be used for your own
                        best interests, rather than against them.</para>
                    <para>Because your attack thoughts will be projected, you will fear attack. And
                        if you fear attack, you must believe that you are not invulnerable. Attack
                        thoughts therefore make you vulnerable in your own mind, which is where the
                        attack thoughts are. Attack thoughts and invulnerability cannot be accepted
                        together. They contradict each other.</para>
                    <para>The idea for today introduces the thought that you always attack yourself
                        first. If attack thoughts must entail the belief that you are vulnerable,
                        their effect is to weaken you in your own eyes. Thus they have attacked your
                        perception of yourself. And because you believe in them, you can no longer
                        believe in yourself. A false image of yourself has come to take the place of
                        what you are.</para>
                    <para>Practice with today's idea will help you to understand that vulnerability
                        or invulnerability is the result of your own thoughts. Nothing except your
                        thoughts can attack you. Nothing except your thoughts can make you think you
                        are vulnerable. And nothing except your thoughts can prove to you this is
                        not so.</para>
                    <para>Six practice periods are required in applying today's idea. A full two
                        minutes should be attempted for each of them, although the time may be
                        reduced to a minute if the discomfort is too great. Do not reduce it
                        further.</para>
                    <para>The practice period should begin with repeating the idea for today, then
                        closing your eyes and reviewing the unresolved questions whose outcomes are
                        causing you concern. The concern may take the form of depression, worry,
                        anger, a sense of imposition, fear, foreboding or preoccupation. Any problem
                        as yet unsettled that tends to recur in your thoughts during the day is a
                        suitable subject. You will not be able to use very many for any one practice
                        period, because a longer time than usual should be spent with each one.
                        Today's idea should be applied as follows:</para>
                    <para>First, name the situation:<blockquote>
                            <para>I am concerned about                                ______.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>Then go over every possible outcome that has occurred to you in that
                        connection and which has caused you concern, referring to each one quite
                        specifically, saying:<blockquote>
                            <para>I am afraid ______ will                                happen.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>If you are doing the exercises properly, you should have some five or six
                        distressing possibilities available for each situation you use, and quite
                        possibly more. It is much more helpful to cover a few situations thoroughly
                        than to touch on a larger number. As the list of anticipated outcomes for
                        each situation continues, you will probably find some of them, especially
                        those that occur to you toward the end, less acceptable to you. Try,
                        however, to treat them all alike to whatever extent you can.</para>
                    <para>After you have named each outcome of which you are afraid, tell yourself:<blockquote>
                            <para>That thought is an attack upon                                    myself.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>Conclude each practice period by repeating today's idea to yourself once
                        more.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 27. Above all else I want to see.</title>
                    <para>Today's idea expresses something stronger than mere determination. It
                        gives vision priority among your desires. You may feel hesitant about using
                        the idea, on the grounds that you are not sure you really mean it. This does
                        not matter. The purpose of today's exercises is to bring the time when the
                        idea will be wholly true a little nearer.</para>
                    <para>There may be a great temptation to believe that some sort of sacrifice is
                        being asked of you when you say you want to see above all else. If you
                        become uneasy about the lack of reservation involved, add:</para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>Vision has no cost to                            anyone.</para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>If fear of loss still persists, add further:<blockquote>
                            <para>It can only bless.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>The idea for today needs many repetitions for maximum benefit. It should
                        be used at least every half hour, and more if possible. You might try for
                        every fifteen or twenty minutes. It is recommended that you set a definite
                        time interval for using the idea when you wake or shortly afterwards, and
                        attempt to adhere to it throughout the day. It will not be difficult to do
                        this, even if you are engaged in conversation, or otherwise occupied at the
                        time. You can still repeat one short sentence to yourself without disturbing
                        anything.</para>
                    <para>The real question is, how often will you remember? How much do you want
                        today's idea to be true? Answer one of these questions, and you have
                        answered the other. You will probably miss several applications, and perhaps
                        quite a number. Do not be disturbed by this, but do try to keep on your
                        schedule from then on. If only once during the day you feel that you were
                        perfectly sincere while you were repeating today's idea, you can be sure
                        that you have saved yourself many years of effort.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 28. Above all else I want to see things differently.</title>
                    <para>Today we are really giving specific application to the idea for yesterday.
                        In these practice periods, you will be making a series of definite
                        commitments. The question of whether you will keep them in the future is not
                        our concern here. If you are willing at least to make them now, you have
                        started on the way to keeping them. And we are still at the
                        beginning.</para>
                    <para>You may wonder why it is important to say, for example, <quote>Above all
                            else I want to see this table differently.</quote> In itself it is not
                        important at all. Yet what is by itself? And what does <quote>in
                            itself</quote> mean? You see a lot of separate things about you, which
                        really means you are not seeing at all. You either see or not. When you have
                        seen one thing differently, you will see all things differently. The light
                        you will see in any one of them is the same light you will see in them
                        all.</para>
                    <para>When you say, Above all else <quote>I want to see this table
                            differently,</quote> you are making a commitment to withdraw your
                        preconceived ideas about the table, and open your mind to what it is, and
                        what it is for. You are not defining it in past terms. You are asking what
                        it is, rather than telling it what it is. You are not binding its meaning to
                        your tiny experience of tables, nor are you limiting its purpose to your
                        little personal thoughts.</para>
                    <para>You will not question what you have already defined. And the purpose of
                        these exercises is to ask questions and receive the answers. In saying,
                        "Above all else I want to see this table differently," you are committing
                        yourself to seeing. It is not an exclusive commitment. It is a commitment
                        that applies to the table just as much as to anything else, neither more nor
                        less.</para>
                    <para>You could, in fact, gain vision from just that table, if you would
                        withdraw all your own ideas from it, and look upon it with a completely open
                        mind. It has something to show you; something beautiful and clean and of
                        infinite value, full of happiness and hope. Hidden under all your ideas
                        about it is its real purpose, the purpose it shares with all the
                        universe.</para>
                    <para>In using the table as a subject for applying the idea for today, you are
                        therefore really asking to see the purpose of the universe. You will be
                        making this same request of each subject that you use in the practice
                        periods. And you are making a commitment to each of them to let its purpose
                        be revealed to you, instead of placing your own judgment upon it.</para>
                    <para>We will have six two-minute practice periods today, in which the idea for
                        the day is stated first, and then applied to whatever you see about you. Not
                        only should the subjects be chosen randomly, but each one should be accorded
                        equal sincerity as today's idea is applied to it, in an attempt to
                        acknowledge the equal value of them all in their contribution to your
                        seeing.</para>
                    <para>As usual, the applications should include the name of the subject your
                        eyes happen to light on, and you should rest your eyes on it while saying:<blockquote>
                            <para>Above all else I want to see this ______                                    differently.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>Each application should be made quite slowly, and as thoughtfully as
                        possible. There is no hurry.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 29. God is in everything I see.</title>
                    <para>The idea for today explains why you can see all purpose in everything. It
                        explains why nothing is separate, by itself or in itself. And it explains
                        why nothing you see means anything. In fact, it explains every idea we have
                        used thus far, and all subsequent ones as well. Today's idea is the whole
                        basis for vision.</para>
                    <para>You will probably find this idea very difficult to grasp at this point.
                        You may find it silly, irreverent, senseless, funny and even objectionable.
                        Certainly God is not in a table, for example, as you see it. Yet we
                        emphasized yesterday that a table shares the purpose of the universe. And
                        what shares the purpose of the universe shares the purpose of its
                        Creator.</para>
                    <para>Try then, today, to begin to learn how to look on all things with love,
                        appreciation and open-mindedness. You do not see them now. Would you know
                        what is in them? Nothing is as it appears to you. Its holy purpose stands
                        beyond your little range. When vision has shown you the holiness that lights
                        up the world, you will understand today's idea perfectly. And you will not
                        understand how you could ever have found it difficult.</para>
                    <para>Our six two-minute practice periods for today should follow a now familiar
                        pattern: Begin with repeating the idea to yourself, and then apply it to
                        randomly chosen subjects about you, naming each one specifically. Try to
                        avoid the tendency toward self-directed selection, which may be particularly
                        tempting in connection with today's idea because of its wholly alien nature.
                        Remember that any order you impose is equally alien to reality.</para>
                    <para>Your list of subjects should therefore be as free of self-selection as
                        possible. For example, a suitable list might include:<blockquote>
                            <para>God is in this coat                                hanger.</para>
                            <para>God is in this magazine.</para>
                            <para>God is in this finger.</para>
                            <para>God is in this lamp.</para>
                            <para>God is in that body.</para>
                            <para>God is in that door.</para>
                            <para>God is in that waste                                basket.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>In addition to the assigned practice periods, repeat the idea for today at
                        least once an hour, looking slowly about you as you say the words
                        unhurriedly to yourself. At least once or twice, you should experience a
                        sense of restfulness as you do this.</para>

                    <para>The idea for today is the springboard for vision. From this idea will the
                        world open up before you, and you will look upon it and see in it what you
                        have never seen before. Nor will what you saw before be even faintly visible
                        to you.</para>

                        Instead, we are trying to see in the world what is in our minds, and what we
                        want to recognize is there. Thus, we are trying to join with what we see,
                        rather than keeping it apart from us. That is the fundamental difference
                        between vision and the way you see.</para>
                    <para>Today's idea should be applied as often as possible throughout the day.
                        Whenever you have a moment or so, repeat it to yourself slowly, looking
                        about you, and trying to realize that the idea applies to everything you do
                        see now, or could see now if it were within the range of your sight.</para>
                    <para>Real vision is not limited to concepts such as <quote>near</quote> and
                            <quote>far.</quote> To help you begin to get used to this idea, try to
                        think of things beyond your present range as well as those you can actually
                        see, as you apply today's idea.</para>
                    <para>Real vision is not only unlimited by space and distance, but it does not
                        depend on the body's eyes at all. The mind is its only source. To aid in
                        helping you to become more accustomed to this idea as well, devote several
                        practice periods to applying today's idea with your eyes closed, using
                        whatever subjects come to mind, and looking within rather than without.
                        Today's idea applies equally to both.</para>

                    <para>Today's idea is the introduction to your declaration of release. Again,
                        the idea should be applied to both the world you see without and the world
                        you see within. In applying the idea, we will use a form of practice which
                        will be used more and more, with changes as indicated. Generally speaking,
                        the form includes two aspects, one in which you apply the idea on a more
                        sustained basis, and the other consisting of frequent applications of the
                        idea throughout the day.</para>
                    <para>Two longer periods of practice with the idea for today are needed, one in
                        the morning and one at night. Three to five minutes for each of these are
                        recommended. During that time, look about you slowly while repeating the
                        idea two or three times. Then close your eyes, and apply the same idea to
                        your inner world. You will escape from both together, for the inner is the
                        cause of the outer.</para>
                    <para>As you survey your inner world, merely let whatever thoughts cross your
                        mind come into your awareness, each to be considered for a moment, and then
                        replaced by the next. Try not to establish any kind of hierarchy among them.
                        Watch them come and go as dispassionately as possible. Do not dwell on any
                        one in particular, but try to let the stream move on evenly and calmly,
                        without any special investment on your part. As you sit and quietly watch
                        your thoughts, repeat today's idea to yourself as often as you care to, but
                        with no sense of hurry.</para>
                    <para>In addition, repeat the idea for today as often as possible during the
                        day. Remind yourself that you are making a declaration of independence in
                        the name of your own freedom. And in your freedom lies the freedom of the
                        world.</para>
                    <para>The idea for today is also a particularly useful one to use as a response
                        to any form of temptation that may arise. It is a declaration that you will
                        not yield to it, and put yourself in bondage.</para>

                    <para>Today we are continuing to develop the theme of cause and effect. You are
                        not the victim of the world you see because you invented it. You can give it
                        up as easily as you made it up. You will see it or not see it, as you wish.
                        While you want it you will see it; when you no longer want it, it will not
                        be there for you to see.</para>
                    <para>The idea for today, like the preceding ones, applies to your inner and
                        outer worlds, which are actually the same. However, since you see them as
                        different, the practice periods for today will again include two phases, one
                        involving the world you see outside you, and the other the world you see in
                        your mind. In today's exercises, try to introduce the thought that both are
                        in your own imagination.</para>
                    <para>Again we will begin the practice periods for the morning and evening by
                        repeating the idea for today two or three times while looking around at the
                        world you see as outside yourself. Then close your eyes and look around your
                        inner world. Try to treat them both as equally as possible. Repeat the idea
                        for today unhurriedly as often as you wish, as you watch the images your
                        imagination presents to your awareness.</para>
                    <para>For the two longer practice periods three to five minutes are recommended,
                        with not less than three required. More than five can be utilized, if you
                        find the exercise restful. To facilitate this, select a time when few
                        distractions are anticipated, and when you yourself feel reasonably
                        ready.</para>
                    <para>These exercises are also to be continued during the day, as often as
                        possible. The shorter applications consist of repeating the idea slowly, as
                        you survey either your inner or outer world. It does not matter which you
                        choose.</para>
                    <para>The idea for today should also be applied immediately to any situation
                        that may distress you. Apply the idea by telling yourself:<blockquote>
                            <para>I have invented this situation as I see                                    it.</para>

                    <para>Today's idea is an attempt to recognize that you can shift your perception
                        of the world in both its outer and inner aspects. A full five minutes should
                        be devoted to the morning and evening applications. In these practice
                        periods, the idea should be repeated as often as you find comfortable,
                        though unhurried applications are essential. Alternate between surveying
                        your outer and inner perceptions, but without an abrupt sense of
                        shifting.</para>
                    <para>Merely glance casually around the world you perceive as outside yourself,
                        then close your eyes and survey your inner thoughts with equal casualness.
                        Try to remain equally uninvolved in both, and to maintain this detachment as
                        you repeat the idea throughout the day.</para>
                    <para>The shorter exercise periods should be as frequent as possible. Specific
                        applications of today's idea should also be made immediately, when any
                        situation arises which tempts you to become disturbed. For these
                        applications, say:<blockquote>
                            <para>There is another way of looking at                                    this.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>Remember to apply today's idea the instant you are aware of distress. It
                        may be necessary to take a minute or so to sit quietly and repeat the idea
                        to yourself several times. Closing your eyes will probably help in this form
                        of application.</para>

                    <para>The idea for today begins to describe the conditions that prevail in the
                        other way of seeing. Peace of mind is clearly an internal matter. It must
                        begin with your own thoughts, and then extend outward. It is from your peace
                        of mind that a peaceful perception of the world arises.</para>
                    <para>Three longer practice periods are required for today's exercises. One in
                        the morning and one in the evening are advised, with an additional one to be
                        undertaken at any time in between that seems most conducive to readiness.
                        All applications should be done with your eyes closed. It is your inner
                        world to which the applications of today's idea should be made.</para>
                    <para>Some five minutes of mind searching are required for each of the longer
                        practice periods. Search your mind for fear thoughts, anxiety-provoking
                        situations, "offending" personalities or events, or anything else about
                        which you are harboring unloving thoughts. Note them all casually, repeating
                        the idea for today slowly as you watch them arise in your mind, and let each
                        one go, to be replaced by the next.</para>
                    <para>If you begin to experience difficulty in thinking of specific subjects,
                        continue to repeat the idea to yourself in an unhurried manner, without
                        applying it to anything in particular. Be sure, however, not to make any
                        specific exclusions.</para>
                    <para>The shorter applications are to be frequent, and made whenever you feel
                        your peace of mind is threatened in any way. The purpose is to protect
                        yourself from temptation throughout the day. If a specific form of
                        temptation arises in your awareness, the exercise should take this form:<blockquote>
                            <para>I could see peace in this                                    situation</para>
                            <para>instead of what I now see in                                    it.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>If the inroads on your peace of mind take the form of more generalized
                        adverse emotions, such as depression, anxiety or worry, use the idea in its
                        original form. If you find you need more than one application of today's
                        idea to help you change your mind in any specific context, try to take
                        several minutes and devote them to repeating the idea until you feel some
                        sense of relief. It will help you if you tell yourself specifically:<blockquote>
                            <para>I can replace my feelings of depression,                                    anxiety or worry</para>

                    <para>Today's idea does not describe the way you see yourself now. It does,
                        however, describe what vision will show you. It is difficult for anyone who
                        thinks he is in this world to believe this of himself. Yet the reason he
                        thinks he is in this world is because he does not believe it.</para>
                    <para>You will believe that you are part of where you think you are. That is
                        because you surround yourself with the environment you want. And you want it
                        to protect the image of yourself that you have made. The image is part of
                        this environment. What you see while you believe you are in it is seen
                        through the eyes of the image. This is not vision. Images cannot see.</para>
                    <para>The idea for today presents a very different view of yourself. By
                        establishing your Source it establishes your Identity, and it describes you
                        as you must really be in truth. We will use a somewhat different kind of
                        application for today's idea because the emphasis for today is on the
                        perceiver, rather than on what he perceives.</para>
                    <para>For each of the three five-minute practice periods today, begin by
                        repeating today's idea to yourself, and then close your eyes and search your
                        mind for the various kinds of descriptive terms in which you see yourself.
                        Include all the ego-based attributes which you ascribe to yourself, positive
                        or negative, desirable or undesirable, grandiose or debased. All of them are
                        equally unreal, because you do not look upon yourself through the eyes of
                        holiness.</para>
                    <para>In the earlier part of the mind-searching period, you will probably
                        emphasize what you consider to be the more negative aspects of your
                        perception of yourself. Toward the latter part of the exercise period,
                        however, more self-inflating descriptive terms may well cross your mind. Try
                        to recognize that the direction of your fantasies about yourself does not
                        matter. Illusions have no direction in reality. They are merely not
                        true.</para>
                    <para>A suitable unselected list for applying the idea for today might be as follows:<blockquote>
                            <para>I see myself as imposed                                on.</para>
                            <para>I see myself as                                depressed.</para>
                            <para>I see myself as failing.</para>
                            <para>I see myself as                                endangered.</para>
                            <para>I see myself as                                helpless.</para>
                            <para>I see myself as                                victorious.</para>
                            <para>I see myself as losing                                out.</para>

                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>You should not think of these terms in an abstract way. They will occur to
                        you as various situations, personalities and events in which you figure
                        cross your mind. Pick up any specific situation that occurs to you, identify
                        the descriptive term or terms you feel are applicable to your reactions to
                        that situation, and use them in applying today's idea. After you have named
                        each one, add:<blockquote>
                            <para>But my mind is part of                                God's.</para>

                    <para>During the longer exercise periods, there will probably be intervals in
                        which nothing specific occurs to you. Do not strain to think up specific
                        things to fill the interval, but merely relax and repeat today's idea slowly
                        until something occurs to you. Although nothing that does occur should be
                        omitted from the exercises, nothing should be <quote>dug out</quote> with
                        effort. Neither force nor discrimination should be used.</para>
                    <para>As often as possible during the day, pick up a specific attribute or
                        attributes you are ascribing to yourself at the time and apply the idea for
                        today to them, adding the idea in the form stated above to each of them. If
                        nothing particular occurs to you, merely repeat the idea to yourself, with
                        closed eyes.</para>

                        perceived. You are holy because your mind is part of God's. And because you
                        are holy, your sight must be holy as well. "Sinless" means without sin. You
                        cannot be without sin a little. You are sinless or not. If your mind is part
                        of God's you must be sinless, or a part of His Mind would be sinful. Your
                        sight is related to His Holiness, not to your ego, and therefore not to your

                        to protect your protection throughout the day. The longer practice periods
                        should take this form:</para>
                    <para>First, close your eyes and repeat the idea for today several times,
                        slowly. Then open your eyes and look quite slowly about you, applying the
                        idea specifically to whatever you note in your casual survey. Say, for example:<blockquote>
                            <para>My holiness envelops that                                rug.</para>

                        own holiness. Thus are you and the world blessed together. No one loses;
                        nothing is taken away from anyone; everyone gains through your holy vision.
                        It signifies the end of sacrifice because it offers everyone his full due.
                        And he is entitled to everything because it is his birthright as a Son of
                        God.</para>
                    <para>There is no other way in which the idea of sacrifice can be removed from
                        the world's thinking. Any other way of seeing will inevitably demand payment
                        of someone or something. As a result, the perceiver will lose. Nor will he
                        have any idea why he is losing. Yet is his wholeness restored to his
                        awareness through your vision. Your holiness blesses him by asking nothing
                        of him. Those who see themselves as whole make no demands.</para>
                    <para>Your holiness is the salvation of the world. It lets you teach the world
                        that it is one with you, not by preaching to it, not by telling it anything,
                        but merely by your quiet recognition that in your holiness are all things
                        blessed along with you.</para>
                    <para>Today's four longer exercise periods, each to involve three to five
                        minutes of practice, begin with the repetition of the idea for today,
                        followed by a minute or so of looking about you as you apply the idea to
                        whatever you see:<blockquote>
                            <para>My holiness blesses this                                chair</para>
                            <para>My holiness blesses that                                window</para>
                            <para>My holiness blesses this                                body.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>Then close your eyes and apply the idea to any person who occurs to you,
                        using his name and saying:<blockquote>
                            <para>My holiness blesses you,                                    [name].</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>You may continue the practice period with your eyes closed; you may open
                        your eyes again and apply the idea for today to your outer world if you so
                        desire; you may alternate between applying the idea to what you see around
                        you and to those who are in your thoughts; or you may use any combination of
                        these two phases of application that you prefer. The practice period should
                        conclude with a repetition of the idea with your eyes closed, and another,
                        following immediately, with your eyes open.</para>
                    <para>The shorter exercises consist of repeating the idea as often as you can.
                        It is particularly helpful to apply it silently to anyone you meet, using
                        his name as you do so. It is essential to use the idea if anyone seems to
                        cause an adverse reaction in you. Offer him the blessing of your holiness
                        immediately, that you may learn to keep it in your own awareness.</para>

                    <para>Your holiness reverses all the laws of the world. It is beyond every
                        restriction of time, space, distance and limits of any kind. Your holiness
                        is totally unlimited in its power because it establishes you as a Son of
                        God, at one with the Mind of his Creator.</para>
                    <para>Through your holiness the power of God is made manifest. Through your
                        holiness the power of God is made available. And there is nothing the power
                        of God cannot do. Your holiness, then, can remove all pain, can end all
                        sorrow, and can solve all problems. It can do so in connection with yourself
                        and with anyone else. It is equal in its power to help anyone because it is
                        equal in its power to save anyone.</para>
                    <para>If you are holy, so is everything God created. You are holy because all
                        things He created are holy. And all things He created are holy because you
                        are. In today's exercises, we will apply the power of your holiness to all
                        problems, difficulties or suffering in any form that you happen to think of,
                        in yourself or in someone else. We will make no distinctions because there
                        are no distinctions.</para>
                    <para>In the four longer practice periods, each preferably to last a full five
                        minutes, repeat the idea for today, close your eyes, and then search your
                        mind for any sense of loss or unhappiness of any kind as you see it. Try to
                        make as little distinction as possible between a situation that is difficult
                        for you, and one that is difficult for someone else. Identify the situation
                        specifically, and also the name of the person concerned. Use this form in

                    <para>From time to time you may want to vary this procedure, and add some
                        relevant thoughts of your own. You might like, for example, to include
                        thoughts such as:<blockquote>
                            <para>There is nothing my holiness cannot                                    do</para>

                        exercises is to begin to instill in you a sense that you have dominion over

                    <para>In the frequent shorter applications, apply the idea in its original form
                        unless a specific problem concerning you or someone else arises, or comes to
                        mind. In that event, use the more specific form in applying the idea to

                    <para>If guilt is hell, what is its opposite? Like the text for which this
                        workbook was written, the ideas used for the exercises are very simple, very
                        clear and totally unambiguous. We are not concerned with intellectual feats
                        nor logical toys. We are dealing only in the very obvious, which has been
                        overlooked in the clouds of complexity in which you think you think.</para>
                    <para>If guilt is hell, what is its opposite? This is not difficult, surely. The
                        hesitation you may feel in answering is not due to the ambiguity of the
                        question. But do you believe that guilt is hell? If you did, you would see
                        at once how direct and simple the text is, and you would not need a workbook
                        at all. No one needs practice to gain what is already his.</para>
                    <para>We have already said that your holiness is the salvation of the world.

                        savior must be saved. How else can he teach salvation? Today's exercises
                        will apply to you, recognizing that your salvation is crucial to the
                        salvation of the world. As you apply the exercises to your world, the whole

                        being asked now, or will be asked in the future. Your holiness means the end
                        of guilt, and therefore the end of hell. Your holiness is the salvation of
                        the world, and your own. How could you to whom your holiness belongs be
                        excluded from it? God does not know un-holiness. Can it be He does not know

                    <para>A full five minutes are urged for the four longer practice periods for
                        today, and longer and more frequent practice sessions are encouraged. If you
                        want to exceed the minimum requirements, more rather than longer sessions
                        are recommended, although both are suggested.</para>
                    <para>Begin the practice periods as usual, by repeating today's idea to
                        yourself. Then, with closed eyes, search out your unloving thoughts in
                        whatever form they appear; uneasiness, depression, anger, fear, worry,
                        attack, insecurity and so on. Whatever form they take, they are unloving and
                        therefore fearful. And so it is from them that you need to be saved.</para>
                    <para>Specific situations, events or personalities you associate with unloving
                        thoughts of any kind are suitable subjects for today's exercises. It is
                        imperative for your salvation that you see them differently. And it is your
                        blessing on them that will save you and give you vision.</para>
                    <para>Slowly, without conscious selection and without undue emphasis on any one
                        in particular, search your mind for every thought that stands between you
                        and your salvation. Apply the idea for today to each of them in this way:<blockquote>
                            <para>My unloving thoughts about ______ are                                    keeping me in hell.</para>
                            <para>My holiness is my                                salvation.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>You may find these practice periods easier if you intersperse them with
                        several short periods during which you merely repeat today's idea to
                        yourself slowly a few times. You may also find it helpful to include a few
                        short intervals in which you just relax and do not seem to be thinking of
                        anything. Sustained concentration is very difficult at first. It will become
                        much easier as your mind becomes more disciplined and less
                        distractible.</para>
                    <para>Meanwhile, you should feel free to introduce variety into the exercise
                        periods in whatever form appeals to you. Do not, however, change the idea
                        itself as you vary the method of applying it. However you elect to use it,
                        the idea should be stated so that its meaning is the fact that your holiness
                        is your salvation. End each practice period by repeating the idea in its
                        original form once more, and adding:<blockquote>
                            <para>If guilt is hell, what is its                                    opposite?</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>In the shorter applications, which should be made some three or four times
                        an hour and more if possible, you may ask yourself this question, repeat
                        today's idea, and preferably both. If temptations arise, a particularly
                        helpful form of the idea is:<blockquote>
                            <para>My holiness is my salvation from                                    this.</para>

                    <para>Today we will begin to assert some of the happy things to which you are
                        entitled, being what you are. No long practice periods are required today,
                        but very frequent short ones are necessary. Once every ten minutes would be
                        highly desirable, and you are urged to attempt this schedule and to adhere
                        to it whenever possible. If you forget, try again. If there are long
                        interruptions, try again. Whenever you remember, try again.</para>
                    <para>You need not close your eyes for the exercise periods, although you will
                        probably find it more helpful if you do. However, you may be in a number of
                        situations during the day when closing your eyes would not be feasible. Do
                        not miss a practice period because of this. You can practice quite well
                        under any circumstances, if you really want to.</para>
                    <para>Today's exercises take little time and no effort. Repeat the idea for
                        today, and then add several of the attributes you associate with being a Son
                        of God, applying them to yourself. One practice period might, for example,
                        consist of the following:<blockquote>
                            <para>I am blessed as a Son of                                God</para>

                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>Another might take this form:<blockquote>

                    <para>If only a brief period is available, merely telling yourself that you are

                    <para>Today's idea will eventually overcome completely the sense of loneliness
                        and abandonment all the separated ones experience. Depression is an
                        inevitable consequence of separation. So are anxiety, worry, a deep sense of

                        to end all this foolishness forever. And foolishness it is, despite the
                        serious and tragic forms it may take.</para>

                        all life goes with you wherever you go. Nothing can destroy your peace of
                        mind because God goes with you wherever you go.</para>
                    <para>We understand that you do not believe all this. How could you, when the
                        truth is hidden deep within, under a heavy cloud of insane thoughts, dense
                        and obscuring, yet representing all you see? Today we will make our first
                        real attempt to get past this dark and heavy cloud, and to go through it to
                        the light beyond.</para>
                    <para>There will be only one long practice period today. In the morning, as soon
                        as you get up if possible, sit quietly for some three to five minutes, with
                        your eyes closed. At the beginning of the practice period, repeat today's
                        idea very slowly. Then make no effort to think of anything. Try, instead, to
                        get a sense of turning inward, past all the idle thoughts of the world. Try
                        to enter very deeply into your own mind, keeping it clear of any thoughts
                        that might divert your attention.</para>
                    <para>From time to time, you may repeat the idea if you find it helpful. But
                        most of all, try to sink down and inward, away from the world and all the
                        foolish thoughts of the world. You are trying to reach past all these
                        things. You are trying to leave appearances and approach reality.</para>
                    <para>It is quite possible to reach God. In fact it is very easy, because it is
                        the most natural thing in the world. You might even say it is the only
                        natural thing in the world. The way will open, if you believe that it is
                        possible. This exercise can bring very startling results even the first time
                        it is attempted, and sooner or later it is always successful. We will go
                        into more detail about this kind of practice as we go along. But it will
                        never fail completely, and instant success is possible.</para>
                    <para>Throughout the day use today's idea often, repeating it very slowly,
                        preferably with eyes closed. Think of what you are saying; what the words
                        mean. Concentrate on the holiness that they imply about you; on the
                        unfailing companionship that is yours; on the complete protection that
                        surrounds you.</para>
                    <para>You can indeed afford to laugh at fear thoughts, remembering that God goes
                        with you wherever you go.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 42. God is my strength. Vision is His gift.</title>
                    <para>The idea for today combines two very powerful thoughts, both of major
                        importance. It also sets forth a cause and effect relationship that explains
                        why you cannot fail in your efforts to achieve the goal of the course. You
                        will see because it is the Will of God. It is His strength, not your own,
                        that gives you power. And it is His gift, rather than your own, that offers
                        vision to you.</para>
                    <para>God is indeed your strength, and what He gives is truly given. This means
                        that you can receive it any time and anywhere, wherever you are, and in
                        whatever circumstance you find yourself. Your passage through time and space
                        is not at random. You cannot but be in the right place at the right time.
                        Such is the strength of God. Such are His gifts.</para>
                    <para>We will have two three-to-five-minute practice periods today, one as soon
                        as possible after you wake, and another as close as possible to the time you
                        go to sleep. It is better, however, to wait until you can sit quietly by
                        yourself, at a time when you feel ready, than it is to be concerned with the
                        time as such.</para>
                    <para>Begin these practice periods by repeating the idea for today slowly, with
                        your eyes open, looking about you. Then close your eyes and repeat the idea
                        again, even slower than before. After this, try to think of nothing except
                        thoughts that occur to you in relation to the idea for the day. You might
                        think, for example:<blockquote>
                            <para>Vision must be possible. God gives                                    truly,</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>or ...<blockquote>
                            <para>God's gifts to me must be mine, because He                                    gave them to me.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>Any thought that is clearly related to the idea for today is suitable. You
                        may, in fact, be astonished at the amount of course-related understanding
                        some of your thoughts contain. Let them come without censoring unless you
                        find your mind is merely wandering, and you have let obviously irrelevant
                        thoughts intrude. You may also reach a point where no thoughts at all seem
                        to come to mind. If such interferences occur, open your eyes and repeat the
                        thought once more while looking slowly about; close your eyes, repeat the
                        idea once more, and then continue to look for related thoughts in your
                        mind.</para>
                    <para>Remember, however, that active searching for relevant thoughts is not
                        appropriate for today's exercises. Try merely to step back and let the
                        thoughts come. If you find this difficult, it is better to spend the
                        practice period alternating between slow repetitions of the idea with eyes
                        open, then with eyes closed, than it is to strain to find suitable
                        thoughts.</para>
                    <para>There is no limit on the number of short practice periods that would be
                        beneficial today. The idea for the day is a beginning step in bringing
                        thoughts together, and teaching you that you are studying a unified thought
                        system in which nothing is lacking that is needed, and nothing is included
                        that is contradictory or irrelevant.</para>
                    <para>The more often you repeat the idea during the day, the more often you will
                        be reminding yourself that the goal of the course is important to you, and
                        that you have not forgotten it.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 43. God is my Source. I cannot see apart from Him.</title>
                    <para>Perception is not an attribute of God. His is the realm of knowledge. Yet
                        He has created the Holy Spirit as the Mediator between perception and
                        knowledge. Without this link with God, perception would have replaced
                        knowledge forever in your mind. With this link with God, perception will
                        become so changed and purified that it will lead to knowledge. That is its
                        function as the Holy Spirit sees it. Therefore, that is its function in
                        truth.</para>
                    <para>In God you cannot see. Perception has no function in God, and does not
                        exist. Yet in salvation, which is the undoing of what never was, perception
                        has a mighty purpose. Made by the Son of God for an unholy purpose, it must
                        become the means for the restoration of his holiness to his awareness.
                        Perception has no meaning. Yet does the Holy Spirit give it a meaning very
                        close to God's. Healed perception becomes the means by which the Son of God
                        forgives his brother, and thus forgives himself.</para>
                    <para>You cannot see apart from God because you cannot be apart from God.
                        Whatever you do you do in Him, because whatever you think, you think with
                        His Mind. If vision is real, and it is real to the extent to which it shares
                        the Holy Spirit's purpose, then you cannot see apart from God.</para>
                    <para>Three five-minute practice periods are required today, one as early and
                        one as late as possible in the day. The third may be undertaken at the most
                        convenient and suitable time that circumstances and readiness permit. At the
                        beginning of these practice periods, repeat the idea for today to yourself
                        with eyes open. Then glance around you for a short time, applying the idea
                        specifically to what you see. Four or five subjects for this phase of the
                        practice period are sufficient. You might say, for example:<blockquote>
                            <para>God is my Source. I cannot see this desk                                    apart from Him</para>
                            <para>God is my Source. I cannot see that                                    picture apart from Him.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>Although this part of the exercise period should be relatively short, be
                        sure that you select the subjects for this phase of practice
                        indiscriminately, without self-directed inclusion or exclusion. For the
                        second and longer phase, close your eyes, repeat today's idea again, and
                        then let whatever relevant thoughts occur to you add to the idea in your own
                        personal way. Thoughts such as:<blockquote>
                            <para>I see through the eyes of                                    forgiveness</para>
                            <para>I see the world as                                blessed</para>
                            <para>The world can show me                                myself</para>
                            <para>I see my own thoughts, which are like                                    God's.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>Any thought related more or less directly to today's idea is suitable. The
                        thoughts need not bear any obvious relationship to the idea, but they should
                        not be in opposition to it.</para>
                    <para>If you find your mind wandering; if you begin to be aware of thoughts
                        which are clearly out of accord with today's idea, or if you seem to be
                        unable to think of anything, open your eyes, repeat the first phase of the
                        exercise period, and then attempt the second phase again. Do not allow any
                        protracted period to occur in which you become preoccupied with irrelevant
                        thoughts. Return to the first phase of the exercises as often as necessary
                        to prevent this.</para>
                    <para>In applying today's idea in the shorter practice periods, the form may
                        vary according to the circumstances and situations in which you find
                        yourself during the day. When you are with someone else, for example, try to
                        remember to tell him silently:<blockquote>
                            <para>God is my Source. I cannot see you apart                                    from Him.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>This form is equally applicable to strangers as it is to those you think
                        are closer to you. In fact, try not to make distinctions of this kind at
                        all. Today's idea should also be applied throughout the day to various
                        situations and events that may occur, particularly to those which seem to
                        distress you in any way. For this purpose, apply the idea in this form:<blockquote>
                            <para>God is my Source. I cannot see this apart                                    from Him.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>If no particular subject presents itself to your awareness at the time,
                        merely repeat the idea in its original form. Try today not to allow any long
                        periods of time to slip by without remembering today's idea, and thus
                        remembering your function.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 44. God is the light in which I see.</title>
                    <para>Today we are continuing the idea for yesterday, adding another dimension
                        to it. You cannot see in darkness, and you cannot make light. You can make
                        darkness and then think you see in it, but light reflects life, and is
                        therefore an aspect of creation. Creation and darkness cannot coexist, but
                        light and life must go together, being but different aspects of
                        creation.</para>
                    <para>In order to see, you must recognize that light is within, not without. You
                        do not see outside yourself, nor is the equipment for seeing outside you. An
                        essential part of this equipment is the light that makes seeing possible. It
                        is with you always, making vision possible in every circumstance.</para>
                    <para>Today we are going to attempt to reach that light. For this purpose, we
                        will use a form of exercise which has been suggested before, and which we
                        will utilize increasingly. It is a particularly difficult form for the
                        undisciplined mind, and represents a major goal of mind training. It
                        requires precisely what the untrained mind lacks. Yet this training must be
                        accomplished if you are to see.</para>
                    <para>Have at least three practice periods today, each lasting three to five
                        minutes. A longer time is highly recommended, but only if you find the time
                        slipping by with little or no sense of strain. The form of practice we will
                        use today is the most natural and easy one in the world for the trained
                        mind, just as it seems to be the most unnatural and difficult for the
                        untrained mind.</para>
                    <para>Your mind is no longer wholly untrained. You are quite ready to learn the
                        form of exercise we will use today, but you may find that you will encounter
                        strong resistance. The reason is very simple. While you practice in this
                        way, you leave behind everything that you now believe, and all the thoughts
                        that you have made up. Properly speaking, this is the release from hell. Yet
                        perceived through the ego's eyes, it is loss of identity and a descent into
                        hell.</para>
                    <para>If you can stand aside from the ego by ever so little, you will have no
                        difficulty in recognizing that its opposition and its fears are meaningless.
                        You might find it helpful to remind yourself, from time to time, that to
                        reach light is to escape from darkness, whatever you may believe to the
                        contrary. God is the light in which you see. You are attempting to reach
                        Him.</para>
                    <para>Begin the practice period by repeating today's idea with your eyes open,
                        and close them slowly, repeating the idea several times more. Then try to
                        sink into your mind, letting go every kind of interference and intrusion by
                        quietly sinking past them. Your mind cannot be stopped in this unless you
                        choose to stop it. It is merely taking its natural course. Try to observe
                        your passing thoughts without involvement, and slip quietly by them.</para>
                    <para>While no particular approach is advocated for this form of exercise, what
                        is needful is a sense of the importance of what you are doing; its
                        inestimable value to you, and an awareness that you are attempting something
                        very holy. Salvation is your happiest accomplishment. It is also the only
                        one that has any meaning, because it is the only one that has any real use
                        to you at all.</para>
                    <para>If resistance rises in any form, pause long enough to repeat today's idea,
                        keeping your eyes closed unless you are aware of fear. In that case, you
                        will probably find it more reassuring to open your eyes briefly. Try,
                        however, to return to the exercises with eyes closed as soon as
                        possible.</para>
                    <para>If you are doing the exercises correctly, you should experience some sense
                        of relaxation, and even a feeling that you are approaching, if not actually
                        entering into light. Try to think of light, formless and without limit, as
                        you pass by the thoughts of this world. And do not forget that they cannot
                        hold you to the world unless you give them the power to do so.</para>
                    <para>Throughout the day repeat the idea often, with eyes open or closed as
                        seems better to you at the time. But do not forget. Above all, be determined
                        not to forget today.</para>

                    <para>Today's idea holds the key to what your real thoughts are. They are
                        nothing that you think you think, just as nothing that you think you see is
                        related to vision in any way. There is no relationship between what is real
                        and what you think is real. Nothing that you think are your real thoughts
                        resemble your real thoughts in any respect. Nothing that you think you see
                        bears any resemblance to what vision will show you.</para>
                    <para>You think with the Mind of God. Therefore you share your thoughts with
                        Him, as He shares His with you. They are the same thoughts, because they are
                        thought by the same Mind. To share is to make alike, or to make one. Nor do
                        the thoughts you think with the Mind of God leave your mind, because
                        thoughts do not leave their source. Therefore, your thoughts are in the Mind
                        of God, as you are. They are in your mind as well, where He is. As you are
                        part of His Mind, so are your thoughts part of His Mind.</para>
                    <para>Where, then, are your real thoughts? Today we will attempt to reach them.
                        We will have to look for them in your mind, because that is where they are.
                        They must still be there, because they cannot have left their source. What
                        is thought by the Mind of God is eternal, being part of creation.</para>
                    <para>Our three five-minute practice periods for today will take the same
                        general form that we used in applying yesterday's idea. We will attempt to
                        leave the unreal and seek for the real. We will deny the world in favor of
                        truth. We will not let the thoughts of the world hold us back. We will not
                        let the beliefs of the world tell us that what God would have us do is
                        impossible. Instead, we will try to recognize that only what God would have
                        us do is possible.</para>
                    <para>We will also try to understand that only what God would have us do is what
                        we want to do. And we will also try to remember that we cannot fail in doing
                        what He would have us do. There is every reason to feel confident that we
                        will succeed today. It is the Will of God.</para>
                    <para>Begin the exercises for today by repeating the idea to yourself, closing
                        your eyes as you do so. Then spend a fairly short period in thinking a few
                        relevant thoughts of your own, keeping the idea in mind. After you have
                        added some four or five thoughts of your own to the idea, repeat it again
                        and tell yourself gently:<blockquote>
                            <para>My real thoughts are in my mind. I would                                    like to find them.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>Then try to go past all the unreal thoughts that cover the truth in your
                        mind, and reach to the eternal.</para>
                    <para>Under all the senseless thoughts and mad ideas with which you have
                        cluttered up your mind are the thoughts that you thought with God in the
                        beginning. They are there in your mind now, completely unchanged. They will
                        always be in your mind, exactly as they always were. Everything you have
                        thought since then will change, but the Foundation on which it rests is
                        wholly changeless.</para>
                    <para>It is this Foundation toward which the exercises for today are directed.
                        Here is your mind joined with the Mind of God. Here are your thoughts one
                        with His. For this kind of practice only one thing is necessary; approach it
                        as you would an altar dedicated in Heaven to God the Father and to God the
                        Son. For such is the place you are trying to reach. You will probably be
                        unable as yet to realize how high you are trying to go. Yet even with the
                        little understanding you have already gained, you should be able to remind
                        yourself that this is no idle game, but an exercise in holiness and an
                        attempt to reach the Kingdom of Heaven.</para>
                    <para>In the shorter exercise periods for today, try to remember how important
                        it is to you to understand the holiness of the mind that thinks with God.
                        Take a minute or two, as you repeat the idea throughout the day, to
                        appreciate your mind's holiness. Stand aside, however briefly, from all
                        thoughts that are unworthy of Him Whose host you are. And thank Him for the
                        Thoughts He is thinking with you.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 46. God is the Love in which I forgive.</title>
                    <para>God does not forgive because He has never condemned. And there must be
                        condemnation before forgiveness is necessary. Forgiveness is the great need
                        of this world, but that is because it is a world of illusions. Those who
                        forgive are thus releasing themselves from illusions, while those who
                        withhold forgiveness are binding themselves to them. As you condemn only
                        yourself, so do you forgive only yourself.</para>
                    <para>Yet although God does not forgive, His Love is nevertheless the basis of
                        forgiveness. Fear condemns and love forgives. Forgiveness thus undoes what
                        fear has produced, returning the mind to the awareness of God. For this
                        reason, forgiveness can truly be called salvation. It is the means by which
                        illusions disappear.</para>
                    <para>Today's exercises require at least three full five-minute practice
                        periods, and as many shorter ones as possible. Begin the longer practice
                        periods by repeating today's idea to yourself, as usual. Close your eyes as
                        you do so, and spend a minute or two in searching your mind for those whom
                        you have not forgiven. It does not matter <quote>how much</quote> you have
                        not forgiven them. You have forgiven them entirely or not at all.</para>
                    <para>If you are doing the exercises well you should have no difficulty in
                        finding a number of people you have not forgiven. It is a safe rule that
                        anyone you do not like is a suitable subject. Mention each one by name, and say:<blockquote>
                            <para>God is the Love in which I forgive you,                                    [name].</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>The purpose of the first phase of today's practice periods is to put you
                        in a position to forgive yourself. After you have applied the idea to all
                        those who have come to mind, tell yourself:<blockquote>
                            <para>God is the Love in which I forgive                                    myself.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>Then devote the remainder of the practice period to adding related ideas
                        such as:<blockquote>
                            <para>God is the Love with which I love                                    myself.</para>
                            <para>God is the Love in which I am                                    blessed.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>The form of the application may vary considerably, but the central idea
                        should not be lost sight of. You might say, for example:<blockquote>
                            <para>I cannot be guilty because I am a Son of                                    God.</para>
                            <para>I have already been                                forgiven.</para>
                            <para>No fear is possible in a mind beloved of                                    God.</para>
                            <para>There is no need to attack because love                                    has forgiven me.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>The practice period should end, however, with a repetition of today's idea
                        as originally stated.</para>
                    <para>The shorter practice periods may consist either of a repetition of the
                        idea for today in the original or in a related form, as you prefer. Be sure,
                        however, to make more specific applications if they are needed. They will be
                        needed at any time during the day when you become aware of any kind of
                        negative reaction to anyone, present or not. In that event, tell him silently:<blockquote>
                            <para>God is the Love in which I forgive                                    you.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 47. God is the strength in which I trust.</title>
                    <para>If you are trusting in your own strength, you have every reason to be
                        apprehensive, anxious and fearful. What can you predict or control? What is
                        there in you that can be counted on? What would give you the ability to be
                        aware of all the facets of any problem, and to resolve them in such a way
                        that only good can come of it? What is there in you that gives you the
                        recognition of the right solution, and the guarantee that it will be
                        accomplished?</para>
                    <para>Of yourself you can do none of these things. To believe that you can is to
                        put your trust where trust is unwarranted, and to justify fear, anxiety,
                        depression, anger and sorrow. Who can put his faith in weakness and feel
                        safe? Yet who can put his faith in strength and feel weak?</para>
                    <para>God is your safety in every circumstance. His Voice speaks for Him in all
                        situations and in every aspect of all situations, telling you exactly what
                        to do to call upon His strength and His protection. There are no exceptions
                        because God has no exceptions. And the Voice which speaks for Him thinks as
                        He does.</para>
                    <para>Today we will try to reach past your own weakness to the Source of real
                        strength. Four five-minute practice periods are necessary today, and longer
                        and more frequent ones are urged. Close your eyes and begin, as usual, by
                        repeating the idea for the day. Then spend a minute or two in searching for
                        situations in your life which you have invested with fear, dismissing each
                        one by telling yourself:<blockquote>
                            <para>God is the strength in which I                                    trust.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>Now try to slip past all concerns related to your own sense of inadequacy.
                        It is obvious that any situation that causes you concern is associated with
                        feelings of inadequacy, for otherwise you would believe that you could deal
                        with the situation successfully. It is not by trusting yourself that you
                        will gain confidence. But the strength of God in you is successful in all
                        things.</para>
                    <para>The recognition of your own frailty is a necessary step in the correction
                        of your errors, but it is hardly a sufficient one in giving you the
                        confidence which you need, and to which you are entitled. You must also gain
                        an awareness that confidence in your real strength is fully justified in
                        every respect and in all circumstances.</para>
                    <para>In the latter phase of the practice period, try to reach down into your
                        mind to a place of real safety. You will recognize that you have reached it
                        if you feel a sense of deep peace, however briefly. Let go all the trivial
                        things that churn and bubble on the surface of your mind, and reach down and
                        below them to the Kingdom of Heaven. There is a place in you where there is
                        perfect peace. There is a place in you where nothing is impossible. There is
                        a place in you where the strength of God abides.</para>
                    <para>During the day, repeat the idea often. Use it as your answer to any
                        disturbance. Remember that peace is your right, because you are giving your
                        trust to the strength of God.</para>

                    <para>The idea for today simply states a fact. It is not a fact to those who
                        believe in illusions, but illusions are not facts. In truth there is nothing
                        to fear. It is very easy to recognize this. But it is very difficult to

                        and repeat the idea slowly to yourself several times. It is particularly
                        important that you use the idea immediately, should anything disturb your
                        peace of mind.</para>
                    <para>The presence of fear is a sure sign that you are trusting in your own
                        strength. The awareness that there is nothing to fear shows that somewhere
                        in your mind, though not necessarily in a place you recognize as yet, you
                        have remembered God, and let His strength take the place of your weakness.

                    <para>The part that is listening to the Voice for God is calm, always at rest
                        and wholly certain. It is really the only part there is. The other part is a
                        wild illusion, frantic and distraught, but without reality of any kind. Try
                        today not to listen to it. Try to identify with the part of your mind where
                        stillness and peace reign forever. Try to hear God's Voice call to you
                        lovingly, reminding you that your Creator has not forgotten His Son.</para>
                    <para>We will need at least four five-minute practice periods today, and more if
                        possible. We will try actually to hear God's Voice reminding you of Him and
                        of your Self. We will approach this happiest and holiest of thoughts with
                        confidence, knowing that in doing so we are joining our will with the Will
                        of God. He wants you to hear His Voice. He gave It to you to be
                        heard.</para>
                    <para>Listen in deep silence. Be very still and open your mind. Go past all the
                        raucous shrieks and sick imaginings that cover your real thoughts and
                        obscure your eternal link with God. Sink deep into the peace that waits for
                        you beyond the frantic, riotous thoughts and sights and sounds of this
                        insane world. You do not live here. We are trying to reach your real home.
                        We are trying to reach the place where you are truly welcome. We are trying
                        to reach God.</para>
                    <para>Do not forget to repeat today's idea very frequently. Do so with your eyes
                        open when necessary, but closed when possible. And be sure to sit quietly
                        and repeat the idea for today whenever you can, closing your eyes on the
                        world, and realizing that you are inviting God's Voice to speak to
                        you.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 50. I am sustained by the Love of God.</title>
                    <para>Here is the answer to every problem that will confront you, today and
                        tomorrow and throughout time. In this world, you believe you are sustained
                        by everything but God. Your faith is placed in the most trivial and insane
                        symbols; pills, money, "protective" clothing, influence, prestige, being
                        liked, knowing the "right" people, and an endless list of forms of
                        nothingness that you endow with magical powers.</para>
                    <para>All these things are your replacements for the Love of God. All these
                        things are cherished to ensure a body identification. They are songs of
                        praise to the ego. Do not put your faith in the worthless. It will not
                        sustain you.</para>
                    <para>Only the Love of God will protect you in all circumstances. It will lift
                        you out of every trial, and raise you high above all the perceived dangers
                        of this world into a climate of perfect peace and safety. It will transport
                        you into a state of mind that nothing can threaten, nothing can disturb, and
                        where nothing can intrude upon the eternal calm of the Son of God.</para>
                    <para>Put not your faith in illusions. They will fail you. Put all your faith in
                        the Love of God within you; eternal, changeless and forever unfailing. This
                        is the answer to whatever confronts you today. Through the Love of God
                        within you, you can resolve all seeming difficulties without effort and in
                        sure confidence. Tell yourself this often today. It is a declaration of
                        release from the belief in idols. It is your acknowledgment of the truth
                        about yourself.</para>
                    <para>For ten minutes, twice today, morning and evening, let the idea for today
                        sink deep into your consciousness. Repeat it, think about it, let related
                        thoughts come to help you recognize its truth, and allow peace to flow over
                        you like a blanket of protection and surety. Let no idle and foolish
                        thoughts enter to disturb the holy mind of the Son of God. Such is the
                        Kingdom of Heaven. Such is the resting place where your Father has placed
                        you forever.</para>

                    <title>Review I Introduction (Lessons 1 - 50)</title>
                    <para>Beginning with today we will have a series of review periods. Each of them
                        will cover five of the ideas already presented, starting with the first and
                        ending with the fiftieth. There will be a few short comments after each of
                        the ideas, which you should consider in your review. In the practice
                        periods, the exercises should be done as follows:</para>
                    <para>Begin the day by reading the five ideas, with the comments included.
                        Thereafter, it is not necessary to follow any particular order in
                        considering them, though each one should be practiced at least once. Devote
                        two minutes or more to each practice period, thinking about the idea and the
                        related comments after reading them over. Do this as often as possible
                        during the day. If any one of the five ideas appeals to you more than the
                        others, concentrate on that one. At the end of the day, however, be sure to
                        review all of them once more.</para>
                    <para>It is not necessary to cover the comments that follow each idea either
                        literally or thoroughly in the practice periods. Try, rather, to emphasize
                        the central point, and think about it as part of your review of the idea to
                        which it relates. After you have read the idea and the related comments, the
                        exercises should be done with your eyes closed and when you are alone in a
                        quiet place, if possible.</para>
                    <para>This is emphasized for practice periods at your stage of learning. It will
                        be necessary, however, that you learn to require no special settings in
                        which to apply what you have learned. You will need your learning most in
                        situations that appear to be upsetting, rather than in those that already
                        seem to be calm and quiet. The purpose of your learning is to enable you to
                        bring the quiet with you, and to heal distress and turmoil. This is not done
                        by avoiding them and seeking a haven of isolation for yourself.</para>
                    <para>You will yet learn that peace is part of you, and requires only that you
                        be there to embrace any situation in which you are. And finally you will
                        learn that there is no limit to where you are, so that your peace is
                        everywhere, as you are.</para>
                    <para>You will note that, for review purposes, some of the ideas are not given
                        in quite their original form. Use them as they are given here. It is not
                        necessary to return to the original statements, nor to apply the ideas as
                        was suggested then. We are now emphasizing the relationships among the first
                        fifty of the ideas we have covered, and the cohesiveness of the thought
                        system to which they are leading you.</para>

                                <para>The reason this is so is that I see nothing, and nothing has
                                    no meaning. It is necessary that I recognize this, that I may
                                    learn to see. What I think I see now is taking the place of
                                    vision. I must let it go by realizing it has no meaning, so that
                                    vision may take its place.</para>

                                    I have given what I see all the meaning it                                        has for me.</para>
                                <para>I have judged everything I look upon, and it is this and only
                                    this I see. This is not vision. It is merely an illusion of
                                    reality, because my judgments have been made quite apart from
                                    reality. I am willing to recognize the lack of validity in my
                                    judgments, because I want to see. My judgments have hurt me, and
                                    I do not want to see according to them.</para>

                                    I do not understand anything I                                        see.</para>
                                <para>How could I understand what I see when I have judged it amiss?
                                    What I see is the projection of my own errors of thought. I do
                                    not understand what I see because it is not understandable.
                                    There is no sense in trying to understand it. But there is every
                                    reason to let it go, and make room for what can be seen and
                                    understood and loved. I can exchange what I see now for this
                                    merely by being willing to do so. Is not this a better choice
                                    than the one I made before?</para>

                                    These thoughts do not mean                                        anything.</para>
                                <para>The thoughts of which I am aware do not mean anything because
                                    I am trying to think without God. What I call <quote>my</quote>
                                    thoughts are not my real thoughts. My real thoughts are the
                                    thoughts I think with God. I am not aware of them because I have
                                    made my thoughts to take their place. I am willing to recognize
                                    that my thoughts do not mean anything, and to let them go. I
                                    choose to have them be replaced by what they were intended to
                                    replace. My thoughts are meaningless, but all creation lies in
                                    the thoughts I think with God.</para>

                                <para>I am never upset for the reason I think because I am

                                    anger is justified and my attacks are warranted. I have not
                                    realized how much I have misused everything I see by assigning
                                    this role to it. I have done this to defend a thought system
                                    that has hurt me, and that I no longer want. I am willing to let
                                    it go.</para>

                                <para>Reality is never frightening. It is impossible that it could
                                    upset me. Reality brings only perfect peace. When I am upset, it
                                    is always because I have replaced reality with illusions I made
                                    up. The illusions are upsetting because I have given them
                                    reality, and thus regard reality as an illusion. Nothing in
                                    God's creation is affected in any way by this confusion of mine.

                                <para>I see only my own thoughts, and my mind is preoccupied with
                                    the past. What, then, can I see as it is? Let me remember that I
                                    look on the past to prevent the present from dawning on my mind.
                                    Let me understand that I am trying to use time against God. Let
                                    me learn to give the past away, realizing that in so doing I am
                                    giving up nothing.</para>

                                    nothing. I can see only what is now. The choice is not whether
                                    to see the past or the present; the choice is merely whether to
                                    see or not. What I have chosen to see has cost me vision. Now I
                                    would choose again, that I may see.</para>

                                    exist, and so they mean nothing. Yet my mind is part of creation

                                    My meaningless thoughts are showing me a                                        meaningless world.</para>
                                <para>Since the thoughts of which I am aware do not mean anything,
                                    the world that pictures them can have no meaning. What is
                                    producing this world is insane, and so is what it produces.
                                    Reality is not insane, and I have real thoughts as well as
                                    insane ones. I can therefore see a real world, if I look to my
                                    real thoughts as my guide for seeing.</para>

                                    I am upset because I see a meaningless                                        world.</para>
                                <para>Insane thoughts are upsetting. They produce a world in which
                                    there is no order anywhere. Only chaos rules a world that
                                    represents chaotic thinking, and chaos has no laws. I cannot
                                    live in peace in such a world. I am grateful that this world is
                                    not real, and that I need not see it at all unless I choose to
                                    value it. And I do not choose to value what is totally insane
                                    and has no meaning.</para>

                                    A meaningless world engenders                                        fear.</para>
                                <para>The totally insane engenders fear because it is completely
                                    undependable, and offers no grounds for trust. Nothing in
                                    madness is dependable. It holds out no safety and no hope. But
                                    such a world is not real. I have given it the illusion of
                                    reality, and have suffered from my belief in it. Now I choose to
                                    withdraw this belief, and place my trust in reality. In choosing
                                    this, I will escape all the effects of the world of fear,
                                    because I am acknowledging that it does not exist.</para>

                                    God did not create a meaningless                                        world.</para>
                                <para>How can a meaningless world exist if God did not create it? He
                                    is the Source of all meaning, and everything that is real is in
                                    His Mind. It is in my mind too, because He created it with me.
                                    Why should I continue to suffer from the effects of my own
                                    insane thoughts, when the perfection of creation is my home? Let
                                    me remember the power of my decision, and recognize where I
                                    really abide.</para>

                                    which there is suffering and loss and death shows me that I am
                                    seeing only the representation of my insane thoughts, and am not
                                    allowing my real thoughts to cast their beneficent light on what
                                    I see. Yet God's way is sure. The images I have made cannot
                                    prevail against Him because it is not my will that they do so.
                                    My will is His, and I will place no other gods before

                                thoughts cannot be without effects. As the world I see arises from
                                my thinking errors, so will the real world rise before my eyes as I
                                let my errors be corrected. My thoughts cannot be neither true nor
                                false. They must be one or the other. What I see shows me which they

                            <para>If I have no private thoughts, I cannot see a private world. Even
                                the mad idea of separation had to be shared before it could form the
                                basis of the world I see. Yet that sharing was a sharing of nothing.
                                I can also call upon my real thoughts, which share everything with
                                everyone. As my thoughts of separation call to the separation
                                thoughts of others, so my real thoughts awaken the real thoughts in
                                them. And the world my real thoughts show me will dawn on their
                                sight as well as mine.</para>

                                replace tears, and abundance to replace loss. I would look upon the
                                real world, and let it teach me that my will and the Will of God are

                                I can escape from this world by giving up                                    attack thoughts.</para>

                                could not see a world of attack. As forgiveness allows love to
                                return to my awareness, I will see a world of peace and safety and
                                joy. And it is this I choose to see, in place of what I look on

                                    My attack thoughts are attacking my                                        invulnerability.</para>
                                <para>How can I know who I am when I see myself as under constant
                                    attack? Pain, illness, loss, age and death seem to threaten me.
                                    All my hopes and wishes and plans appear to be at the mercy of a
                                    world I cannot control. Yet perfect security and complete
                                    fulfillment are my inheritance. I have tried to give my
                                    inheritance away in exchange for the world I see. But God has
                                    kept my inheritance safe for me. My own real thoughts will teach
                                    me what it is.</para>

                                <para>Recognizing that what I see reflects what I think I am, I
                                    realize that vision is my greatest need. The world I see attests
                                    to the fearful nature of the self-image I have made. If I would
                                    remember who I am, it is essential that I let this image of
                                    myself go. As it is replaced by truth, vision will surely be
                                    given me. And with this vision, I will look upon the world and
                                    on myself with charity and love.</para>

                                    now, truth cannot enter my awareness. I would let the door

                                    the world that reflects the Love of God.</para>

                                    lost the knowledge of Who I am because I have forgotten it. It

                                    leave simply by walking out. Nothing holds me in this world.
                                    Only my wish to stay keeps me a prisoner. I would give up my

                                    Son of God must be forever free. He is as God created him, and
                                    not what I would make of him. He is where God would have him be,
                                    and not where I thought to hold him prisoner.</para>

                                    within myself. The world I look upon has taken on the light of
                                    my forgiveness, and shines forgiveness back at me. In this light

                                    because there is nothing that does not share my holiness. As I
                                    recognize my holiness, so does the holiness of the world shine
                                    forth for everyone to see.</para>

                                <para>My holiness is unlimited in its power to heal, because it is
                                    unlimited in its power to save. What is there to be saved from
                                    except illusions? And what are all illusions except false ideas
                                    about myself? My holiness undoes them all by asserting the truth
                                    about me. In the presence of my holiness, which I share with God
                                    Himself, all idols vanish.</para>

                                <para>Since my holiness saves me from all guilt, recognizing my
                                    holiness is recognizing my salvation. It is also recognizing the
                                    salvation of the world. Once I have accepted my holiness,
                                    nothing can make me afraid. And because I am unafraid, everyone
                                    must share in my understanding, which is the gift of God to me
                                    and to the world.</para>

                                    because of Who I am. My Father supports me, protects me, and
                                    directs me in all things. His care for me is infinite, and is

                                    given by God. Christ's vision is His gift, and He has given it
                                    to me. Let me call upon this gift today, so that this day may

                                    by which I will recognize my innocence. It is the reflection of
                                    God's Love on earth. It will bring me near enough to Heaven that
                                    the Love of God can reach down to me and raise me up to

                                    forgive. As I begin to see, I recognize His reflection on earth.
                                    I forgive all things because I feel the stirring of His strength
                                    in me. And I begin to remember the Love I chose to forget, but

                    <para>Who is the light of the world except God's Son? This, then, is merely a
                        statement of the truth about yourself. It is the opposite of a statement of
                        pride, of arrogance, or of self-deception. It does not describe the
                        selfconcept you have made. It does not refer to any of the characteristics
                        with which you have endowed your idols. It refers to you as you were created
                        by God. It simply states the truth.</para>
                    <para> To the ego, today's idea is the epitome of self-glorification. But the
                        ego does not understand humility, mistaking it for self-debasement. Humility
                        consists of accepting your role in salvation and in taking no other. It is
                        not humility to insist you cannot be the light of the world if that is the
                        function God assigned to you. It is only arrogance that would assert this
                        function cannot be for you, and arrogance is always of the ego. </para>
                    <para> True humility requires that you accept today's idea because it is God's
                        Voice which tells you it is true. This is a beginning step in accepting your
                        real function on earth. It is a giant stride toward taking your rightful
                        place in salvation. It is a positive assertion of your right to be saved,
                        and an acknowledgment of the power that is given you to save others. </para>
                    <para> You will want to think about this idea as often as possible today. It is
                        the perfect answer to all illusions, and therefore to all temptation. It
                        brings all the images you have made about yourself to the truth, and helps
                        you depart in peace, unburdened and certain of your purpose.</para>
                    <para> As many practice periods as possible should be undertaken today, although
                        each one need not exceed a minute or two. They should begin with telling
                        yourself: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>I am the light of the world. That is my only                                function. That is why I am here. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Then think about these statements for a short while, preferably with your
                        eyes closed if the situation permits. Let a few related thoughts come to
                        you, and repeat the idea to yourself if your mind wanders away from the
                        central thought. </para>
                    <para> Be sure both to begin and end the day with a practice period. Thus you
                        will awaken with an acknowledgment of the truth about yourself, reinforce it
                        throughout the day, and turn to sleep as you reaffirm your function and your
                        only purpose here. These two practice periods may be longer than the rest,
                        if you find them helpful and want to extend them. </para>
                    <para> Today's idea goes far beyond the ego's petty views of what you are and
                        what your purpose is. As a bringer of salvation, this is obviously
                        necessary. This is the first of a number of giant steps we will take in the
                        next few weeks. Try today to begin to build a firm foundation for these
                        advances. You are the light of the world. God has built His plan for the
                        salvation of His Son on you. </para>

                    <para>It is your forgiveness that will bring the world of darkness to the light.
                        It is your forgiveness that lets you recognize the light in which you see.
                        Forgiveness is the demonstration that you are the light of the world.
                        Through your forgiveness does the truth about yourself return to your
                        memory. Therefore, in your forgiveness lies your salvation.</para>
                    <para>llusions about yourself and the world are one. That is why all forgiveness
                        is a gift to yourself. Your goal is to find out who you are, having denied
                        your Identity by attacking creation and its Creator. Now you are learning
                        how to remember the truth. For this attack must be replaced by forgiveness,
                        so that thoughts of life may replace thoughts of death. </para>
                    <para> Remember that in every attack you call upon your own weakness, while each
                        time you forgive you call upon the strength of Christ in you. Do you not
                        then begin to understand what forgiveness will do for you? It will remove
                        all sense of weakness, strain and fatigue from your mind. It will take away
                        all fear and guilt and pain. It will restore the invulnerability and power
                        God gave His Son to your awareness. </para>

                        to use it as frequently as possible throughout the day. It will help to make
                        the day as happy for you as God wants you to be. And it will help those
                        around you, as well as those who seem to be far away in space and time, to
                        share this happiness with you. </para>
                    <para>As often as you can, closing your eyes if possible, say to yourself today: </para>

                        <para>Forgiveness is my function as the light of the
                                world. I would fulfill my function that I may be happy.

                    <para>Then devote a minute or two to considering your function and the happiness
                        and release it will bring you. Let related thoughts come freely, for your
                        heart will recognize these words, and in your mind is the awareness they are
                        true. Should your attention wander, repeat the idea and add: </para>

                        happiness?</para>
                    <para> You are indeed the light of the world with such a function. The Son of
                        God looks to you for his redemption. It is yours to give him, for it belongs
                        to you. Accept no trivial purpose or meaningless desire in its place, or you
                        will forget your function and leave the Son of God in hell. This is no idle
                        request that is being asked of you. You are being asked to accept salvation
                        that it may be yours to give. </para>
                    <para> Recognizing the importance of this function, we will be happy to remember
                        it very often today. We will begin the day by acknowledging it, and close
                        the day with the thought of it in our awareness. And throughout the day we
                        will repeat this as often as we can: </para>

                    <para> If you close your eyes, you will probably find it easier to let the

                        considering this. Do not, however, wait for such an opportunity. No chance
                        should be lost for reinforcing today's idea. Remember that God's Son looks

                    <title>Lesson 64. Let me not forget my function.</title>
                    <para>Today's idea is merely another way of saying "Let me not wander into
                        temptation." The purpose of the world you see is to obscure your function of
                        forgiveness, and provide you with a justification for forgetting it. It is
                        the temptation to abandon God and His Son by taking on a physical
                        appearance. It is this the body's eyes look upon.</para>
                    <para> Nothing the body's eyes seem to see can be anything but a form of
                        temptation, since this was the purpose of the body itself. Yet we have
                        learned that the Holy Spirit has another use for all the illusions you have
                        made, and therefore He sees another purpose in them. To the Holy Spirit, the
                        world is a place where you learn to forgive yourself what you think of as
                        your sins. In this perception, the physical appearance of temptation becomes
                        the spiritual recognition of salvation. </para>
                    <para> To review our last few lessons, your function here is to be the light of
                        the world, a function given you by God. It is only the arrogance of the ego
                        that leads you to question this, and only the fear of the ego that induces
                        you to regard yourself as unworthy of the task assigned to you by God
                        Himself. The world's salvation awaits your forgiveness, because through it
                        does the Son of God escape from all illusions, and thus from all temptation.
                        The Son of God is you. </para>
                    <para> Only by fulfilling the function given you by God will you be happy. That
                        is because your function is to be happy by using the means by which
                        happiness becomes inevitable. There is no other way. Therefore, every time
                        you choose whether or not to fulfill your function, you are really choosing
                        whether or not to be happy. </para>
                    <para> Let us remember this today. Let us remind ourselves of it in the morning
                        and again at night, and all through the day as well. Prepare yourself in
                        advance for all the decisions you will make today by remembering they are
                        all really very simple. Each one will lead to happiness or unhappiness. Can
                        such a simple decision really be difficult to make? Let not the form of the
                        decision deceive you. Complexity of form does not imply complexity of
                        content. It is impossible that any decision on earth can have a content
                        different from just this one simple choice. That is the only choice the Holy
                        Spirit sees. Therefore it is the only choice there is. </para>
                    <para> Today, then, let us practice with these thoughts: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>Let me not forget my function. Let me not try
                                to substitute mine for God's. Let me forgive and be happy.
                            </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>At least once devote ten or fifteen minutes today to reflecting on this
                        with closed eyes. Related thoughts will come to help you, if you remember
                        the crucial importance of your function to you and to the world. </para>
                    <para> In the frequent applications of today's idea throughout the day, devote
                        several minutes to reviewing these thoughts, and then thinking about them
                        and about nothing else. This will be difficult, at first particularly, since
                        you are not proficient in the mind discipline that it requires. You may need
                        to repeat "Let me not forget my function" quite often to help you
                        concentrate. </para>
                    <para> Two forms of shorter practice periods are required. At times, do the
                        exercises with your eyes closed, trying to concentrate on the thoughts you
                        are using. At other times, keep your eyes open after reviewing the thoughts,
                        and then look slowly and unselectively around you, telling yourself: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>This is the world it is my function to save.                            </para>
                    </blockquote>
                </section>
                <section xml:id="L065">
                    <title>Lesson 65. My only function is the one God gave me.</title>
                    <para>The idea for today reaffirms your commitment to salvation. It also reminds
                        you that you have no function other than that. Both these thoughts are
                        obviously necessary for a total commitment. Salvation cannot be the only
                        purpose you hold while you still cherish others. The full acceptance of
                        salvation as your only function necessarily entails two phases; the
                        recognition of salvation as your function, and the relinquishment of all the
                        other goals you have invented for yourself.</para>
                    <para> This is the only way in which you can take your rightful place among the
                        saviors of the world. This is the only way in which you can say and mean,
                        "My only function is the one God gave me." This is the only way in which you
                        can find peace of mind. </para>
                    <para> Today, and for a number of days to follow, set aside ten to fifteen
                        minutes for a more sustained practice period, in which you try to understand
                        and accept what the idea for the day really means. Today's idea offers you
                        escape from all your perceived difficulties. It places the key to the door
                        of peace, which you have closed upon yourself, in your own hands. It gives
                        you the answer to all the searching you have done since time began. </para>
                    <para> Try, if possible, to undertake the daily extended practice periods at
                        approximately the same time each day. Try, also, to determine this time in
                        advance, and then adhere to it as closely as possible. The purpose of this
                        is to arrange your day so that you have set apart the time for God, as well
                        as for all the trivial purposes and goals you will pursue. This is part of
                        the long-range disciplinary training your mind needs, so that the Holy
                        Spirit can use it consistently for the purpose He shares with you. </para>
                    <para> For the longer practice period, begin by reviewing the idea for the day.
                        Then close your eyes, repeat the idea to yourself once again, and watch your
                        mind carefully to catch whatever thoughts cross it. At first, make no
                        attempt to concentrate only on thoughts related to the idea for the day.
                        Rather, try to uncover each thought that arises to interfere with it. Note
                        each one as it comes to you, with as little involvement or concern as
                        possible, dismissing each one by telling yourself: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>This thought reflects a goal that is                                preventing me from accepting my only function. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para> After a while, interfering thoughts will become harder to find. Try,
                        however, to continue a minute or so longer, attempting to catch a few of the
                        idle thoughts that escaped your attention before, but do not strain or make
                        undue effort in doing this. Then tell yourself: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>On this clean slate let my true function be                                written for me. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>You need not use these exact words, but try to get the sense of being
                        willing to have your illusions of purpose be replaced by truth. </para>
                    <para> Finally, repeat the idea for today once more, and devote the rest of the
                        practice period to trying to focus on its importance to you, the relief its
                        acceptance will bring you by resolving your conflicts once and for all, and
                        the extent to which you really want salvation in spite of your own foolish
                        ideas to the contrary. </para>
                    <para> In the shorter practice periods, which should be undertaken at least once
                        an hour, use this form in applying today's idea: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>My only function is the one God gave me. I                                want no other and I have no other. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Sometimes close your eyes as you practice this, and sometimes keep them
                        open and look about you. It is what you see now that will be totally changed
                        when you accept today's idea completely. </para>

                    <para>You have surely noticed an emphasis throughout our recent lessons on the
                        connection between fulfilling your function and achieving happiness. This is

                        Holy Spirit about what your happiness is. It is not a two-way battle. The
                        ego attacks and the Holy Spirit does not respond. He knows what your
                        function is. He knows that it is your happiness. </para>
                    <para> Today we will try to go past this wholly meaningless battle and arrive at
                        the truth about your function. We will not engage in senseless arguments
                        about what it is. We will not become hopelessly involved in defining
                        happiness and determining the means for achieving it. We will not indulge
                        the ego by listening to its attacks on truth. We will merely be glad that we
                        can find out what truth is. </para>
                    <para> Our longer practice period today has as its purpose your acceptance of
                        the fact that not only is there a very real connection between the function
                        God gave you and your happiness, but that they are actually identical. God
                        gives you only happiness. Therefore, the function He gave you must be
                        happiness, even if it appears to be different. Today's exercises are an
                        attempt to go beyond these differences in appearance, and recognize a common
                        content where it exists in truth. </para>
                    <para> Begin the ten-to-fifteen-minute practice period by reviewing these
                        thoughts: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>God gives me only happiness. He has given my function to me. Therefore my function must be happiness.
                            </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para> Try to see the logic in this sequence, even if you do not yet accept the
                        conclusion. It is only if the first two thoughts are wrong that the
                        conclusion could be false. Let us, then, think about the premises for a
                        while, as we are practicing. </para>
                    <para> The first premise is that God gives you only happiness. This could be
                        false, of course, but in order to be false it is necessary to define God as
                        something He is not. Love cannot give evil, and what is not happiness is
                        evil. God cannot give what He does not have, and He cannot have what He is
                        not. Unless God gives you only happiness, He must be evil. And it is this
                        definition of Him you are believing if you do not accept the first premise. </para>
                    <para> The second premise is that God has given you your function. We have seen
                        that there are only two parts of your mind. One is ruled by the ego, and is
                        made up of illusions. The other is the home of the Holy Spirit, where truth
                        abides. There are no other guides but these to choose between, and no other
                        outcomes possible as a result of your choice but the fear that the ego
                        always engenders, and the love that the Holy Spirit always offers to replace
                        it. </para>
                    <para> Thus, it must be that your function is established by God through His
                        Voice, or is made by the ego which you have made to replace Him. Which is
                        true? Unless God gave your function to you, it must be the gift of the ego.
                        Does the ego really have gifts to give, being itself an illusion and
                        offering only the illusion of gifts? </para>
                    <para> Think about this during the longer practice period today. Think also
                        about the many forms the illusion of your function has taken in your mind,
                        and the many ways in which you tried to find salvation under the ego's
                        guidance. Did you find it? Were you happy? Did they bring you peace? We need
                        great honesty today. Remember the outcomes fairly, and consider also whether
                        it was ever reasonable to expect happiness from anything the ego ever
                        proposed. Yet the ego is the only alternative to the Holy Spirit's Voice. </para>
                    <para> You will listen to madness or hear the truth. Try to make this choice as
                        you think about the premises on which our conclusion rests. We can share in
                        this conclusion, but in no other. For God Himself shares it with us. Today's
                        idea is another giant stride in the perception of the same as the same, and
                        the different as different. On one side stand all illusions. All truth
                        stands on the other. Let us try today to realize that only the truth is
                        true. </para>
                    <para> In the shorter practice periods, which would be most helpful today if
                        undertaken twice an hour, this form of the application is suggested: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>My happiness and function are one, because God                                has given me both. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>It will not take more than a minute, and probably less, to repeat these
                        words slowly and think about them a little while as you say them. </para>

                    <para>Today's idea is a complete and accurate statement of what you are. This is
                        why you are the light of the world. This is why God appointed you as the
                        world's savior. This is why the Son of God looks to you for his salvation.
                        He is saved by what you are. We will make every effort today to reach this
                        truth about you, and to realize fully, if only for a moment, that it is the
                        truth.</para>
                    <para> In the longer practice period, we will think about your reality and its

                        truth about you, and then spend a few minutes adding some relevant thoughts,
                        such as: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>Holiness created me holy.Kindness created me kind. Helpfulness created me
                                helpful. Perfection created me perfect. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para> Any attribute which is in accord with God as He defines Himself is
                        appropriate for use. We are trying today to undo your definition of God and
                        replace it with His Own. We are also trying to emphasize that you are part
                        of His definition of Himself. </para>
                    <para> After you have gone over several such related thoughts, try to let all
                        thoughts drop away for a brief preparatory interval, and then try to reach
                        past all your images and preconceptions about yourself to the truth in you.
                        If love created you like itself, this Self must be in you. And somewhere in
                        your mind It is there for you to find. </para>
                    <para> You may find it necessary to repeat the idea for today from time to time
                        to replace distracting thoughts. You may also find that this is not
                        sufficient, and that you need to continue adding other thoughts related to
                        the truth about yourself. Yet perhaps you will succeed in going past that,
                        and through the interval of thoughtlessness to the awareness of a blazing
                        light in which you recognize yourself as love created you. Be confident that
                        you will do much today to bring that awareness nearer, whether you feel you
                        have succeeded or not. </para>
                    <para> It will be particularly helpful today to practice the idea for the day as
                        often as you can. You need to hear the truth about yourself as frequently as
                        possible, because your mind is so preoccupied with false self-images. Four
                        or five times an hour, and perhaps even more, it would be most beneficial to
                        remind yourself that love created you like itself. Hear the truth about
                        yourself in this. </para>
                    <para> Try to realize in the shorter practice periods that this is not your
                        tiny, solitary voice that tells you this. This is the Voice for God,
                        reminding you of your Father and of your Self. This is the Voice of truth,
                        replacing everything that the ego tells you about yourself with the simple

                    <para>You who were created by love like itself can hold no grievances and know
                        your Self. To hold a grievance is to forget who you are. To hold a grievance
                        is to see yourself as a body. To hold a grievance is to let the ego rule
                        your mind and to condemn the body to death. Perhaps you do not yet fully
                        realize just what holding grievances does to your mind. It seems to split
                        you off from your Source and make you unlike Him. It makes you believe that
                        He is like what you think you have become, for no one can conceive of his
                        Creator as unlike himself.</para>
                    <para> Shut off from your Self, which remains aware of Its likeness to Its
                        Creator, your Self seems to sleep, while the part of your mind that weaves
                        illusions in its sleep appears to be awake. Can all this arise from holding
                        grievances? Oh, yes! For he who holds grievances denies he was created by
                        love, and his Creator has become fearful to him in his dream of hate. Who
                        can dream of hatred and not fear God? </para>
                    <para> It is as sure that those who hold grievances will redefine God in their
                        own image, as it is certain that God created them like Himself, and defined
                        them as part of Him. It is as sure that those who hold grievances will
                        suffer guilt, as it is certain that those who forgive will find peace. It is
                        as sure that those who hold grievances will forget who they are, as it is
                        certain that those who forgive will remember. </para>
                    <para> Would you not be willing to relinquish your grievances if you believed
                        all this were so? Perhaps you do not think you can let your grievances go.
                        That, however, is simply a matter of motivation. Today we will try to find
                        out how you would feel without them. If you succeed even by ever so little,
                        there will never be a problem in motivation ever again. </para>

                        against whom you hold what you regard as major grievances. Some of these
                        will be quite easy to find. Then think of the seemingly minor grievances you
                        hold against those you like and even think you love. It will quickly become
                        apparent that there is no one against whom you do not cherish grievances of
                        some sort. This has left you alone in all the universe in your perception of
                        yourself. </para>
                    <para> Determine now to see all these people as friends. Say to them all,

                    <para>Spend the remainder of the practice period trying to think of yourself as

                        protects you and loves you, and that you love in return. Try to feel safety
                        surrounding you, hovering over you and holding you up. Try to believe,
                        however briefly, that nothing can harm you in any way. At the end of the
                        practice period tell yourself: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>Love holds no grievances. When I let all my                                grievances go I will know I am perfectly safe. </para>

                    <para>In addition, repeat the idea several times an hour in this form: </para>

                    <para>No one can look upon what your grievances conceal. Because your grievances
                        are hiding the light of the world in you, everyone stands in darkness, and
                        you beside him. But as the veil of your grievances is lifted, you are
                        released with him. Share your salvation now with him who stood beside you

                    <para> Today let us make another real attempt to reach the light in you. Before

                        several minutes to thinking about what we are trying to do. We are literally
                        attempting to get in touch with the salvation of the world. We are trying to
                        see past the veil of darkness that keeps it concealed. We are trying to let
                        the veil be lifted, and to see the tears of God's Son disappear in the
                        sunlight. </para>
                    <para> Let us begin our longer practice period today with the full realization
                        that this is so, and with real determination to reach what is dearer to us
                        than all else. Salvation is our only need. There is no other purpose here,
                        and no other function to fulfill. Learning salvation is our only goal. Let
                        us end the ancient search today by finding the light in us, and holding it
                        up for everyone who searches with us to look upon and rejoice. </para>
                    <para> Very quietly now, with your eyes closed, try to let go of all the content
                        that generally occupies your consciousness. Think of your mind as a vast
                        circle, surrounded by a layer of heavy, dark clouds. You can see only the
                        clouds because you seem to be standing outside the circle and quite apart
                        from it. </para>
                    <para> From where you stand, you can see no reason to believe there is a
                        brilliant light hidden by the clouds. The clouds seem to be the only
                        reality. They seem to be all there is to see. Therefore, you do not attempt
                        to go through them and past them, which is the only way in which you would
                        be really convinced of their lack of substance. We will make this attempt
                        today. </para>

                        Determine to go past the clouds. Reach out and touch them in your mind.
                        Brush them aside with your hand; feel them resting on your cheeks and
                        forehead and eyelids as you go through them. Go on; clouds cannot stop you. </para>
                    <para> If you are doing the exercises properly, you will begin to feel a sense
                        of being lifted up and carried ahead. Your little effort and small
                        determination call on the power of the universe to help you, and God Himself
                        will raise you from darkness into light. You are in accord with His Will.
                        You cannot fail because your will is His. </para>
                    <para> Have confidence in your Father today, and be certain that He has heard
                        you and answered you. You may not recognize His answer yet, but you can
                        indeed be sure that it is given you and you will yet receive it. Try, as you
                        attempt to go through the clouds to the light, to hold this confidence in
                        your mind. Try to remember that you are at last joining your will to God's.
                        Try to keep the thought clearly in mind that what you undertake with God
                        must succeed. Then let the power of God work in you and through you, that
                        His Will and yours be done. </para>
                    <para> In the shorter practice periods, which you will want to do as often as
                        possible in view of the importance of today's idea to you and your
                        happiness, remind yourself that your grievances are hiding the light of the
                        world from your awareness. Remind yourself also that you are not searching
                        for it alone, and that you do know where to look for it. Say, then: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>My grievances hide the light of the world in
                                me. I cannot see what I have hidden. Yet I want to let it be
                                revealed to me, for my salvation and the salvation of the world.
                            </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Also, be sure to tell yourself: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>If I hold this grievance the light of the                                world will be hidden from me, </para>

                    <title>Lesson 70. My salvation comes from me.</title>
                    <para>All temptation is nothing more than some form of the basic temptation not
                        to believe the idea for today. Salvation seems to come from anywhere except
                        from you. So, too, does the source of guilt. You see neither guilt nor
                        salvation as in your own mind and nowhere else. When you realize that all
                        guilt is solely an invention of your mind, you also realize that guilt and
                        salvation must be in the same place. In understanding this you are
                        saved.</para>
                    <para> The seeming cost of accepting today's idea is this: It means that nothing
                        outside yourself can save you; nothing outside yourself can give you peace.
                        But it also means that nothing outside yourself can hurt you, or disturb
                        your peace or upset you in any way. Today's idea places you in charge of the
                        universe, where you belong because of what you are. This is not a role that
                        can be partially accepted. And you must surely begin to see that accepting
                        it is salvation. </para>
                    <para> It may not, however, be clear to you why the recognition that guilt is in
                        your own mind entails the realization that salvation is there as well. God
                        would not have put the remedy for the sickness where it cannot help. That is
                        the way your mind has worked, but hardly His. He wants you to be healed, so
                        He has kept the Source of healing where the need for healing lies. </para>
                    <para> You have tried to do just the opposite, making every attempt, however
                        distorted and fantastic it might be, to separate healing from the sickness
                        for which it was intended, and thus keep the sickness. Your purpose was to
                        ensure that healing did not occur. God's purpose was to ensure that it did. </para>
                    <para> Today we practice realizing that God's Will and ours are really the same
                        in this. God wants us to be healed, and we do not really want to be sick,
                        because it makes us unhappy. Therefore, in accepting the idea for today, we
                        are really in agreement with God. He does not want us to be sick. Neither do
                        we. He wants us to be healed. So do we. </para>
                    <para> We are ready for two longer practice periods today, each of which should
                        last some ten to fifteen minutes. We will, however, still let you decide
                        when to undertake them. We will follow this practice for a number of
                        lessons, and it would again be well to decide in advance when would be a
                        good time to lay aside for each of them, and then adhering to your own
                        decisions as closely as possible. </para>
                    <para>Begin these practice periods by repeating the idea for today, adding a
                        statement signifying your recognition that salvation comes from nothing
                        outside of you. You might put it this way: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>My salvation comes from me. It cannot come                                from anywhere else. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Then devote a few minutes, with your eyes closed, to reviewing some of the
                        external places where you have looked for salvation in the past;–in other
                        people, in possessions, in various situations and events, and in
                        self-concepts that you sought to make real. Recognize that it is not there,
                        and tell yourself: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>My salvation cannot come from any of these
                                things. My salvation comes from me and only from me.
                            </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para> Now we will try again to reach the light in you, which is where your
                        salvation is. You cannot find it in the clouds that surround the light, and
                        it is in them you have been looking for it. It is not there. It is past the
                        clouds and in the light beyond. Remember that you will have to go through
                        the clouds before you can reach the light. But remember also that you have
                        never found anything in the cloud patterns you imagined that endured, or
                        that you wanted. </para>
                    <para> Since all illusions of salvation have failed you, surely you do not want
                        to remain in the clouds, looking vainly for idols there, when you could so
                        easily walk on into the light of real salvation. Try to pass the clouds by
                        whatever means appeals to you. If it helps you, think of me holding your
                        hand and leading you. And I assure you this will be no idle fantasy. </para>
                    <para> For the short and frequent practice periods today, remind yourself that
                        your salvation comes from you, and nothing but your own thoughts can hamper
                        your progress. You are free from all external interference. You are in
                        charge of your salvation. You are in charge of the salvation of the world.
                        Say, then: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>My salvation comes from me. Nothing outside of
                                me can hold me back. Within me is the world's salvation and my own.
                            </para>

                <section xml:id="L071">
                    <title>Lesson 71. Only God's plan for salvation will work.</title>
                    <para>You may not realize that the ego has set up a plan for salvation in
                        opposition to God's. It is this plan in which you believe. Since it is the
                        opposite of God's, you also believe that to accept God's plan in place of
                        the ego's is to be damned. This sounds preposterous, of course. Yet after we
                        have considered just what the ego's plan is, perhaps you will realize that,
                        however preposterous it may be, you do believe in it.</para>
                    <para> The ego's plan for salvation centers around holding grievances. It
                        maintains that, if someone else spoke or acted differently, if some external
                        circumstance or event were changed, you would be saved. Thus, the source of
                        salvation is constantly perceived as outside yourself. Each grievance you
                        hold is a declaration, and an assertion in which you believe, that says, "If
                        this were different, I would be saved." The change of mind necessary for
                        salvation is thus demanded of everyone and everything except yourself. </para>
                    <para> The role assigned to your own mind in this plan, then, is simply to
                        determine what, other than itself, must change if you are to be saved.
                        According to this insane plan, any perceived source of salvation is
                        acceptable provided that it will not work. This ensures that the fruitless
                        search will continue, for the illusion persists that, although this hope has
                        always failed, there is still grounds for hope in other places and in other
                        things. Another person will yet serve better; another situation will yet
                        offer success. </para>
                    <para> Such is the ego's plan for your salvation. Surely you can see how it is
                        in strict accord with the ego's basic doctrine, "Seek but do not find." For
                        what could more surely guarantee that you will not find salvation than to
                        channelize all your efforts in searching for it where it is not? </para>
                    <para> God's plan for salvation works simply because, by following His
                        direction, you seek for salvation where it is. But if you are to succeed, as
                        God promises you will, you must be willing to seek there only. Otherwise,
                        your purpose is divided and you will attempt to follow two plans for
                        salvation that are diametrically opposed in all ways. The result can only
                        bring confusion, misery and a deep sense of failure and despair. </para>
                    <para> How can you escape all this? Very simply. The idea for today is the
                        answer. Only God's plan for salvation will work. There can be no real
                        conflict about this, because there is no possible alternative to God's plan
                        that will save you. His is the only plan that is certain in its outcome. His
                        is the only plan that must succeed. </para>
                    <para> Let us practice recognizing this certainty today. And let us rejoice that
                        there is an answer to what seems to be a conflict with no resolution
                        possible. All things are possible to God. Salvation must be yours because of
                        His plan, which cannot fail. </para>
                    <para> Begin the two longer practice periods for today by thinking about today's
                        idea, and realizing that it contains two parts, each making equal
                        contribution to the whole. God's plan for your salvation will work, and
                        other plans will not. Do not allow yourself to become depressed or angry at
                        the second part; it is inherent in the first. And in the first is your full
                        release from all your own insane attempts and mad proposals to free
                        yourself. They have led to depression and anger; but God's plan will
                        succeed. It will lead to release and joy. </para>
                    <para> Remembering this, let us devote the remainder of the extended practice
                        periods to asking God to reveal His plan to us. Ask Him very specifically: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>What would You have me do? Where would You have me go? What would You have me
                                say, and to whom? </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Give Him full charge of the rest of the practice period, and let Him tell
                        you what needs to be done by you in His plan for your salvation. He will
                        answer in proportion to your willingness to hear His Voice. Refuse not to
                        hear. The very fact that you are doing the exercises proves that you have
                        some willingness to listen. This is enough to establish your claim to God's
                        answer. </para>
                    <para>In the shorter practice periods, tell yourself often that God's plan for
                        salvation, and only His, will work. Be alert to all temptation to hold
                        grievances today, and respond to them with this form of today's idea: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>Holding grievances is the opposite of God's                                plan for salvation. And only His plan will work. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Try to remember today's idea some six or seven times an hour. There could
                        be no better way to spend a half minute or less than to remember the Source
                        of your salvation, and to see It where It is. </para>
                </section>
                <section xml:id="L072">
                    <title>Lesson 72. Holding grievances is an attack on God's plan for
                        salvation.</title>
                    <para>While we have recognized that the ego's plan for salvation is the opposite
                        of God's, we have not yet emphasized that it is an active attack on His
                        plan, and a deliberate attempt to destroy it. In the attack, God is assigned
                        the attributes which are actually associated with the ego, while the ego
                        appears to take on the attributes of God.</para>
                    <para> The ego's fundamental wish is to replace God. In fact, the ego is the
                        physical embodiment of that wish. For it is that wish that seems to surround
                        the mind with a body, keeping it separate and alone, and unable to reach
                        other minds except through the body that was made to imprison it. The limit
                        on communication cannot be the best means to expand communication. Yet the
                        ego would have you believe that it is. </para>
                    <para> Although the attempt to keep the limitations that a body would impose is
                        obvious here, it is perhaps not so apparent why holding grievances is an
                        attack on God's plan for salvation. But let us consider the kinds of things
                        you are apt to hold grievances for. Are they not always associated with
                        something a body does? A person says something you do not like. He does
                        something that displeases you. He "betrays" his hostile thoughts in his
                        behavior. </para>
                    <para> You are not dealing here with what the person is. On the contrary, you
                        are exclusively concerned with what he does in a body. You are doing more
                        than failing to help in freeing him from the body's limitations. You are
                        actively trying to hold him to it by confusing it with him, and judging them
                        as one. Herein is God attacked, for if His Son is only a body, so must He be
                        as well. A creator wholly unlike his creation is inconceivable. </para>
                    <para> If God is a body, what must His plan for salvation be? What could it be
                        but death? In trying to present Himself as the Author of life and not of
                        death, He is a liar and a deceiver, full of false promises and offering
                        illusions in place of truth. The body's apparent reality makes this view of
                        God quite convincing. In fact, if the body were real, it would be difficult
                        indeed to escape this conclusion. And every grievance that you hold insists
                        that the body is real. It overlooks entirely what your brother is. It
                        reinforces your belief that he is a body, and condemns him for it. And it
                        asserts that his salvation must be death, projecting this attack onto God,
                        and holding Him responsible for it. </para>
                    <para> To this carefully prepared arena, where angry animals seek for prey and
                        mercy cannot enter, the ego comes to save you. God made you a body. Very
                        well. Let us accept this and be glad. As a body, do not let yourself be
                        deprived of what the body offers. Take the little you can get. God gave you
                        nothing. The body is your only savior. It is the death of God and your
                        salvation. </para>
                    <para>This is the universal belief of the world you see. Some hate the body, and
                        try to hurt and humiliate it. Others love the body, and try to glorify and
                        exalt it. But while the body stands at the center of your concept of
                        yourself, you are attacking God's plan for salvation, and holding your
                        grievances against Him and His creation, that you may not hear the Voice of
                        truth and welcome It as Friend. Your chosen savior takes His place instead.
                        It is your friend; He is your enemy. </para>
                    <para>We will try today to stop these senseless attacks on salvation. We will
                        try to welcome it instead. Your upside-down perception has been ruinous to
                        your peace of mind. You have seen yourself in a body and the truth outside
                        you, locked away from your awareness by the body's limitations. Now we are
                        going to try to see this differently. </para>
                    <para> The light of truth is in us, where it was placed by God. It is the body
                        that is outside us, and is not our concern. To be without a body is to be in
                        our natural state. To recognize the light of truth in us is to recognize
                        ourselves as we are. To see our Self as separate from the body is to end the
                        attack on God's plan for salvation, and to accept it instead. And wherever
                        His plan is accepted, it is accomplished already. </para>
                    <para> Our goal in the longer practice periods today is to become aware that
                        God's plan for salvation has already been accomplished in us. To achieve
                        this goal, we must replace attack with acceptance. As long as we attack it,
                        we cannot understand what God's plan for us is. We are therefore attacking
                        what we do not recognize. Now we are going to try to lay judgment aside, and
                        ask what God's plan for us is: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>What is salvation, Father? I do not know. Tell                                me, that I may understand. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Then we will wait in quiet for His answer. We have attacked God's plan for
                        salvation without waiting to hear what it is. We have shouted our grievances
                        so loudly that we have not listened to His Voice. We have used our
                        grievances to close our eyes and stop our ears. </para>
                    <para> Now we would see and hear and learn. "What is salvation, Father?" Ask and
                        you will be answered. Seek and you will find. We are no longer asking the
                        ego what salvation is and where to find it. We are asking it of truth. Be
                        certain, then, that the answer will be true because of Whom you ask. </para>
                    <para> Whenever you feel your confidence wane and your hope of success flicker
                        and go out, repeat your question and your request, remembering that you are
                        asking of the infinite Creator of infinity, Who created you like Himself: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>What is salvation, Father? I do not know. Tell                                me, that I may understand. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>He will answer. Be determined to hear. </para>
                    <para> One or perhaps two shorter practice periods an hour will be enough for
                        today, since they will be somewhat longer than usual. These exercises should
                        begin with this: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>Holding grievances is an attack on God's plan
                                for salvation. Let me accept it instead. What is salvation, Father?
                            </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Then wait a minute or so in silence, preferably with your eyes closed, and
                        listen for His answer. </para>
                </section>
                <section xml:id="L073">
                    <title>Lesson 73. I will there be light.</title>
                    <para>Today we are considering the will you share with God. This is not the same
                        as the ego's idle wishes, out of which darkness and nothingness arise. The
                        will you share with God has all the power of creation in it. The ego's idle
                        wishes are unshared, and therefore have no power at all. Its wishes are not
                        idle in the sense that they can make a world of illusions in which your
                        belief can be very strong. But they are idle indeed in terms of creation.
                        They make nothing that is real.</para>
                    <para> Idle wishes and grievances are partners or co-makers in picturing the
                        world you see. The wishes of the ego gave rise to it, and the ego's need for
                        grievances, which are necessary to maintain it, peoples it with figures that
                        seem to attack you and call for "righteous" judgment. These figures become
                        the middlemen the ego employs to traffic in grievances. They stand between
                        your awareness and your brothers' reality. Beholding them, you do not know
                        your brothers or your Self. </para>
                    <para> Your will is lost to you in this strange bartering, in which guilt is
                        traded back and forth, and grievances increase with each exchange. Can such
                        a world have been created by the Will the Son of God shares with his Father?
                        Did God create disaster for His Son? Creation is the Will of Both together.
                        Would God create a world that kills Himself? </para>
                    <para> Today we will try once more to reach the world that is in accordance with
                        your will. The light is in it because it does not oppose the Will of God. It
                        is not Heaven, but the light of Heaven shines on it. Darkness has vanished.
                        The ego's idle wishes have been withdrawn. Yet the light that shines upon
                        this world reflects your will, and so it must be in you that we will look
                        for it. </para>
                    <para> Your picture of the world can only mirror what is within. The source of
                        neither light nor darkness can be found without. Grievances darken your
                        mind, and you look out on a darkened world. Forgiveness lifts the darkness,
                        reasserts your will, and lets you look upon a world of light. We have
                        repeatedly emphasized that the barrier of grievances is easily passed, and
                        cannot stand between you and your salvation. The reason is very simple. Do
                        you really want to be in hell? Do you really want to weep and suffer and
                        die? </para>
                    <para> Forget the ego's arguments which seek to prove all this is really Heaven.
                        You know it is not so. You cannot want this for yourself. There is a point
                        beyond which illusions cannot go. Suffering is not happiness, and it is
                        happiness you really want. Such is your will in truth. And so salvation is
                        your will as well. You want to succeed in what we are trying to do today. We
                        undertake it with your blessing and your glad accord. </para>
                    <para> We will succeed today if you remember that you want salvation for
                        yourself. You want to accept God's plan because you share in it. You have no
                        will that can really oppose it, and you do not want to do so. Salvation is
                        for you. Above all else, you want the freedom to remember Who you really
                        are. Today it is the ego that stands powerless before your will. Your will
                        is free, and nothing can prevail against it. </para>
                    <para> Therefore, we undertake the exercises for today in happy confidence,
                        certain that we will find what it is your will to find, and remember what it
                        is your will to remember. No idle wishes can detain us, nor deceive us with
                        an illusion of strength. Today let your will be done, and end forever the
                        insane belief that it is hell in place of Heaven that you choose. </para>
                    <para> We will begin our longer practice periods with the recognition that God's
                        plan for salvation, and only His, is wholly in accord with your will. It is
                        not the purpose of an alien power, thrust upon you unwillingly. It is the
                        one purpose here on which you and your Father are in perfect accord. You
                        will succeed today, the time appointed for the release of the Son of God
                        from hell and from all idle wishes. His will is now restored to his
                        awareness. He is willing this very day to look upon the light in him and be
                        saved. </para>
                    <para> After reminding yourself of this, and determining to keep your will
                        clearly in mind, tell yourself with gentle firmness and quiet certainty: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>I will there be light. Let me behold the light                                that reflects God's Will and mine. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Then let your will assert itself, joined with the power of God and united
                        with your Self. Put the rest of the practice period under Their guidance.
                        Join with Them as They lead the way. </para>
                    <para> In the shorter practice periods, again make a declaration of what you
                        really want. Say: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>I will there be light. Darkness is not my                                will. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>This should be repeated several times an hour. It is most important,
                        however, to apply today's idea in this form immediately you are tempted to
                        hold a grievance of any kind. This will help you let your grievances go,
                        instead of cherishing them and hiding them in darkness. </para>
                </section>
                <section xml:id="L074">
                    <title>Lesson 74. There is no will but God's.</title>
                    <para>The idea for today can be regarded as the central thought toward which all
                        our exercises are directed. God's is the only Will. When you have recognized
                        this, you have recognized that your will is His. The belief that conflict is
                        possible has gone. Peace has replaced the strange idea that you are torn by
                        conflicting goals. As an expression of the Will of God, you have no goal but
                        His.</para>
                    <para> There is great peace in today's idea, and the exercises for today are
                        directed towards finding it. The idea itself is wholly true. Therefore it
                        cannot give rise to illusions. Without illusions conflict is impossible. Let
                        us try to recognize this today, and experience the peace this recognition
                        brings. </para>
                    <para> Begin the longer practice periods by repeating these thoughts several
                        times, slowly and with firm determination to understand what they mean, and
                        to hold them in mind: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>There is no will but God's. I cannot be in                                conflict. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Then spend several minutes in adding some related thoughts, such as: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>I am at peace. Nothing can disturb me. My will is God's. My will and
                                God's are one. God wills peace for His Son. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>During this introductory phase, be sure to deal quickly with any conflict
                        thoughts that may cross your mind. Tell yourself immediately: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>There is no will but God's. These conflict                                thoughts are meaningless. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para> If there is one conflict area that seems particularly difficult to
                        resolve, single it out for special consideration. Think about it briefly but
                        very specifically, identify the particular person or persons and the
                        situation or situations involved, and tell yourself: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>There is no will but God's. I share it with                                Him. My conflicts about _____ cannot be real. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para> After you have cleared your mind in this way, close your eyes and try to
                        experience the peace to which your reality entitles you. Sink into it and
                        feel it closing around you. There may be some temptation to mistake these
                        attempts for withdrawal, but the difference is easily detected. If you are
                        succeeding, you will feel a deep sense of joy and an increased alertness,
                        rather than a feeling of drowsiness and enervation. </para>
                    <para> Joy characterizes peace. By this experience will you recognize that you
                        have reached it. If you feel yourself slipping off into withdrawal, quickly
                        repeat the idea for today and try again. Do this as often as necessary.
                        There is definite gain in refusing to allow retreat into withdrawal, even if
                        you do not experience the peace you seek. </para>
                    <para> In the shorter periods, which should be undertaken at regular and
                        predetermined intervals today, say to yourself: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>There is no will but God's. I seek His peace                                today. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para> Then try to find what you are seeking. A minute or two every half an
                        hour, with eyes closed if possible, would be well spent on this today.
                    </para>

                        world, because the light has come. </para>
                    <para> Our exercises for today will be happy ones, in which we offer thanks for
                        the passing of the old and the beginning of the new. No shadows from the
                        past remain to darken our sight and hide the world forgiveness offers us.
                        Today we will accept the new world as what we want to see. We will be given
                        what we desire. We will to see the light; the light has come. </para>
                    <para> Our longer practice periods will be devoted to looking at the world that
                        our forgiveness shows us. This is what we want to see, and only this. Our
                        single purpose makes our goal inevitable. Today the real world rises before
                        us in gladness, to be seen at last. Sight is given us, now that the light
                        has come. </para>
                    <para> We do not want to see the ego's shadow on the world today. We see the
                        light, and in it we see Heaven's reflection lie across the world. Begin the
                        longer practice periods by telling yourself the glad tidings of your
                        release: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>The light has come. I have forgiven the world.                            </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para> Dwell not upon the past today. Keep a completely open mind, washed of all
                        past ideas and clean of every concept you have made. You have forgiven the
                        world today. You can look upon it now as if you never saw it before. You do
                        not know yet what it looks like. You merely wait to have it shown to you.
                        While you wait, repeat several times, slowly and in complete patience: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>The light has come. I have forgiven the world.                            </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para> Realize that your forgiveness entitles you to vision. Understand that the
                        Holy Spirit never fails to give the gift of sight to the forgiving. Believe
                        He will not fail you now. You have forgiven the world. He will be with you
                        as you watch and wait. He will show you what true vision sees. It is His
                        Will, and you have joined with Him. Wait patiently for Him. He will be
                        there. The light has come. You have forgiven the world. </para>
                    <para> Tell Him you know you cannot fail because you trust in Him. And tell
                        yourself you wait in certainty to look upon the world He promised you. From
                        this time forth you will see differently. Today the light has come. And you
                        will see the world that has been promised you since time began, and in which
                        is the end of time ensured. </para>
                    <para> The shorter practice periods, too, will be joyful reminders of your
                        release. Remind yourself every quarter of an hour or so that today is a time
                        for special celebration. Give thanks for mercy and the Love of God. Rejoice
                        in the power of forgiveness to heal your sight completely. Be confident that
                        on this day there is a new beginning. Without the darkness of the past upon
                        your eyes, you cannot fail to see today. And what you see will be so welcome
                        that you will gladly extend today forever. </para>
                    <para> Say, then: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>The light has come. I have forgiven the world.                            </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Should you be tempted, say to anyone who seems to pull you back into
                        darkness: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>The light has come. I have forgiven you.                            </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para> We dedicate this day to the serenity in which God would have you be. Keep
                        it in your awareness of yourself and see it everywhere today, as we
                        celebrate the beginning of your vision and the sight of the real world,
                        which has come to replace the unforgiven world you thought was real. </para>

                    <title>Lesson 76. I am under no laws but God's.</title>
                    <para>We have observed before how many senseless things have seemed to you to be
                        salvation. Each has imprisoned you with laws as senseless as itself. You are
                        not bound by them. Yet to understand that this is so, you must first realize
                        salvation lies not there. While you would seek for it in things that have no
                        meaning, you bind yourself to laws that make no sense. Thus do you seek to
                        prove salvation is where it is not.</para>
                    <para> Today we will be glad you cannot prove it. For if you could, you would
                        forever seek salvation where it is not, and never find it. The idea for
                        today tells you once again how simple is salvation. Look for it where it
                        waits for you, and there it will be found. Look nowhere else, for it is
                        nowhere else. </para>
                    <para> Think of the freedom in the recognition that you are not bound by all the
                        strange and twisted laws you have set up to save you. You really think that
                        you would starve unless you have stacks of green paper strips and piles of
                        metal discs. You really think a small round pellet or some fluid pushed into
                        your veins through a sharpened needle will ward off disease and death. You
                        really think you are alone unless another body is with you. </para>
                    <para> It is insanity that thinks these things. You call them laws, and put them
                        under different names in a long catalogue of rituals that have no use and
                        serve no purpose. You think you must obey the "laws" of medicine, of
                        economics and of health. Protect the body, and you will be saved. </para>
                    <para> These are not laws, but madness. The body is endangered by the mind that
                        hurts itself. The body suffers just in order that the mind will fail to see
                        it is the victim of itself. The body's suffering is a mask the mind holds up
                        to hide what really suffers. It would not understand it is its own enemy;
                        that it attacks itself and wants to die. It is from this your "laws" would
                        save the body. It is for this you think you are a body. </para>
                    <para> There are no laws except the laws of God. This needs repeating, over and
                        over, until you realize it applies to everything that you have made in
                        opposition to God's Will. Your magic has no meaning. What it is meant to
                        save does not exist. Only what it is meant to hide will save you. </para>
                    <para> The laws of God can never be replaced. We will devote today to rejoicing
                        that this is so. It is no longer a truth that we would hide. We realize
                        instead it is a truth that keeps us free forever. Magic imprisons, but the
                        laws of God make free. The light has come because there are no laws but His. </para>
                    <para> We will begin the longer practice periods today with a short review of
                        the different kinds of "laws" we have believed we must obey. These would
                        include, for example, the "laws" of nutrition, of immunization, of
                        medication, and of the body's protection in innumerable ways. Think further;
                        you believe in the "laws" of friendship, of "good" relationships and
                        reciprocity. Perhaps you even think that there are laws which set forth what
                        is God's and what is yours. Many "religions" have been based on this. They
                        would not save but damn in Heaven's name. Yet they are no more strange than
                        other "laws" you hold must be obeyed to make you safe. </para>
                    <para> There are no laws but God's. Dismiss all foolish magical beliefs today,
                        and hold your mind in silent readiness to hear the Voice that speaks the
                        truth to you. You will be listening to One Who says there is no loss under
                        the laws of God. Payment is neither given nor received. Exchange cannot be
                        made; there are no substitutes; and nothing is replaced by something else.
                        God's laws forever give and never take. </para>
                    <para> Hear Him Who tells you this, and realize how foolish are the "laws" you
                        thought upheld the world you thought you saw. Then listen further. He will
                        tell you more. About the Love your Father has for you. About the endless joy
                        He offers you. About His yearning for His only Son, created as His channel
                        for creation; denied to Him by his belief in hell. </para>
                    <para> Let us today open God's channels to Him, and let His Will extend through
                        us to Him. Thus is creation endlessly increased. His Voice will speak of
                        this to us, as well as of the joys of Heaven which His laws keep limitless
                        forever. We will repeat today's idea until we have listened and understood
                        there are no laws but God's. Then we will tell ourselves, as a dedication
                        with which the practice period concludes: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>I am under no laws but God's.                            </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para> We will repeat this dedication as often as possible today; at least four
                        or five times an hour, as well as in response to any temptation to
                        experience ourselves as subject to other laws throughout the day. It is our
                        statement of freedom from all danger and all tyranny. It is our
                        acknowledgment that God is our Father, and that His Son is saved. </para>
                </section>
                <section xml:id="L077">
                    <title>Lesson 77. I am entitled to miracles.</title>
                    <para>You are entitled to miracles because of what you are. You will receive
                        miracles because of what God is. And you will offer miracles because you are
                        one with God. Again, how simple is salvation! It is merely a statement of
                        your true Identity. It is this that we will celebrate today.</para>
                    <para> Your claim to miracles does not lie in your illusions about yourself. It
                        does not depend on any magical powers you have ascribed to yourself, nor on
                        any of the rituals you have devised. It is inherent in the truth of what you
                        are. It is implicit in what God your Father is. It was ensured in your
                        creation, and guaranteed by the laws of God. </para>
                    <para> Today we will claim the miracles which are your right, since they belong
                        to you. You have been promised full release from the world you made. You
                        have been assured that the Kingdom of God is within you, and can never be
                        lost. We ask no more than what belongs to us in truth. Today, however, we
                        will also make sure that we will not content ourselves with less. </para>
                    <para> Begin the longer practice periods by telling yourself quite confidently
                        that you are entitled to miracles. Closing your eyes, remind yourself that
                        you are asking only for what is rightfully yours. Remind yourself also that
                        miracles are never taken from one and given to another, and that in asking
                        for your rights, you are upholding the rights of everyone. Miracles do not
                        obey the laws of this world. They merely follow from the laws of God. </para>
                    <para> After this brief introductory phase, wait quietly for the assurance that
                        your request is granted. You have asked for the salvation of the world, and
                        for your own. You have requested that you be given the means by which this
                        is accomplished. You cannot fail to be assured in this. You are but asking
                        that the Will of God be done. </para>
                    <para> In doing this, you do not really ask for anything. You state a fact that
                        cannot be denied. The Holy Spirit cannot but assure you that your request is
                        granted. The fact that you accepted must be so. There is no room for doubt
                        and uncertainty today. We are asking a real question at last. The answer is
                        a simple statement of a simple fact. You will receive the assurance that you
                        seek. </para>
                    <para> Our shorter practice periods will be frequent, and will also be devoted
                        to a reminder of a simple fact. Tell yourself often today: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>I am entitled to miracles. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Ask for them whenever a situation arises in which they are called for. You
                        will recognize these situations. And since you are not relying on yourself
                        to find the miracle, you are fully entitled to receive it whenever you ask. </para>
                    <para> Remember, too, not to be satisfied with less than the perfect answer. Be
                        quick to tell yourself, should you be tempted: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>I will not trade miracles for grievances. I
                                want only what belongs to me. God has established miracles as my
                                right. </para>
                    </blockquote>

                <section xml:id="L078">
                    <title>Lesson 78. Let miracles replace all grievances.</title>
                    <para>Perhaps it is not yet quite clear to you that each decision that you make
                        is one between a grievance and a miracle. Each grievance stands like a dark
                        shield of hate before the miracle it would conceal. And as you raise it up
                        before your eyes, you will not see the miracle beyond. Yet all the while it
                        waits for you in light, but you behold your grievances instead.</para>
                    <para> Today we go beyond the grievances, to look upon the miracle instead. We
                        will reverse the way you see by not allowing sight to stop before it sees.
                        We will not wait before the shield of hate, but lay it down and gently lift
                        our eyes in silence to behold the Son of God. </para>
                    <para> He waits for you behind your grievances, and as you lay them down he will
                        appear in shining light where each one stood before. For every grievance is
                        a block to sight, and as it lifts you see the Son of God where he has always
                        been. He stands in light, but you were in the dark. Each grievance made the
                        darkness deeper, and you could not see. </para>
                    <para> Today we will attempt to see God's Son. We will not let ourselves be
                        blind to him; we will not look upon our grievances. So is the seeing of the
                        world reversed, as we look out toward truth, away from fear. We will select
                        one person you have used as target for your grievances, and lay the
                        grievances aside and look at him. Someone, perhaps, you fear and even hate;
                        someone you think you love who angered you; someone you call a friend, but
                        whom you see as difficult at times or hard to please, demanding, irritating
                        or untrue to the ideal he should accept as his, according to the role you
                        set for him. </para>
                    <para> You know the one to choose; his name has crossed your mind already. He
                        will be the one of whom we ask God's Son be shown to you. Through seeing him
                        behind the grievances that you have held against him, you will learn that
                        what lay hidden while you saw him not is there in everyone, and can be seen.
                        He who was enemy is more than friend when he is freed to take the holy role
                        the Holy Spirit has assigned to him. Let him be savior unto you today. Such
                        is his role in God your Father's plan. </para>
                    <para> Our longer practice periods today will see him in this role. You will
                        attempt to hold him in your mind, first as you now consider him. You will
                        review his faults, the difficulties you have had with him, the pain he
                        caused you, his neglect, and all the little and the larger hurts he gave.
                        You will regard his body with its flaws and better points as well, and you
                        will think of his mistakes and even of his "sins." </para>
                    <para> Then let us ask of Him Who knows this Son of God in his reality and
                        truth, that we may look on him a different way, and see our savior shining
                        in the light of true forgiveness, given unto us. We ask Him in the holy Name
                        of God and of His Son, as holy as Himself: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>Let me behold my savior in this one You have
                                appointed as the one for me to ask to lead me to the holy light in
                                which he stands, that I may join with him. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>The body's eyes are closed, and as you think of him who grieved you, let
                        your mind be shown the light in him beyond your grievances. </para>
                    <para> What you have asked for cannot be denied. Your savior has been waiting
                        long for this. He would be free, and make his freedom yours. The Holy Spirit
                        leans from him to you, seeing no separation in God's Son. And what you see
                        through Him will free you both. Be very quiet now, and look upon your
                        shining savior. No dark grievances obscure the sight of him. You have
                        allowed the Holy Spirit to express through him the role God gave Him that
                        you might be saved. </para>
                    <para> God thanks you for these quiet times today in which you laid your images
                        aside, and looked upon the miracle of love the Holy Spirit showed you in
                        their place. The world and Heaven join in thanking you, for not one Thought
                        of God but must rejoice as you are saved, and all the world with you. </para>
                    <para> We will remember this throughout the day, and take the role assigned to
                        us as part of God's salvation plan, and not our own. Temptation falls away
                        when we allow each one we meet to save us, and refuse to hide his light
                        behind our grievances. To everyone you meet, and to the ones you think of or
                        remember from the past, allow the role of savior to be given, that you may
                        share it with him. For you both, and all the sightless ones as well, we
                        pray: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>Let miracles replace all grievances.                            </para>

                    <title>Lesson 79. Let me recognize the problem so it can be solved.</title>
                    <para>A problem cannot be solved if you do not know what it is. Even if it is
                        really solved already you will still have the problem, because you will not
                        recognize that it has been solved. This is the situation of the world. The
                        problem of separation, which is really the only problem, has already been
                        solved. Yet the solution is not recognized because the problem is not
                        recognized.</para>
                    <para> Everyone in this world seems to have his own special problems. Yet they
                        are all the same, and must be recognized as one if the one solution that
                        solves them all is to be accepted. Who can see that a problem has been
                        solved if he thinks the problem is something else? Even if he is given the
                        answer, he cannot see its relevance. </para>
                    <para> That is the position in which you find yourself now. You have the answer,
                        but you are still uncertain about what the problem is. A long series of
                        different problems seems to confront you, and as one is settled the next one
                        and the next arise. There seems to be no end to them. There is no time in
                        which you feel completely free of problems and at peace. </para>
                    <para> The temptation to regard problems as many is the temptation to keep the
                        problem of separation unsolved. The world seems to present you with a vast
                        number of problems, each requiring a different answer. This perception
                        places you in a position in which your problem solving must be inadequate,
                        and failure is inevitable. </para>
                    <para> No one could solve all the problems the world appears to hold. They seem
                        to be on so many levels, in such varying forms and with such varied content,
                        that they confront you with an impossible situation. Dismay and depression
                        are inevitable as you regard them. Some spring up unexpectedly, just as you
                        think you have resolved the previous ones. Others remain unsolved under a
                        cloud of denial, and rise to haunt you from time to time, only to be hidden
                        again but still unsolved. </para>
                    <para> All this complexity is but a desperate attempt not to recognize the
                        problem, and therefore not to let it be resolved. If you could recognize
                        that your only problem is separation, no matter what form it takes, you
                        could accept the answer because you would see its relevance. Perceiving the
                        underlying constancy in all the problems that seem to confront you, you
                        would understand that you have the means to solve them all. And you would
                        use the means, because you recognize the problem. </para>
                    <para> In our longer practice periods today we will ask what the problem is, and
                        what is the answer to it. We will not assume that we already know. We will
                        try to free our minds of all the many different kinds of problems we think
                        we have. We will try to realize that we have only one problem, which we have
                        failed to recognize. We will ask what it is, and wait for the answer. We
                        will be told. Then we will ask for the solution to it. And we will be told. </para>
                    <para> The exercises for today will be successful to the extent to which you do
                        not insist on defining the problem. Perhaps you will not succeed in letting
                        all your preconceived notions go, but that is not necessary. All that is
                        necessary is to entertain some doubt about the reality of your version of
                        what your problems are. You are trying to recognize that you have been given
                        the answer by recognizing the problem, so that the problem and the answer
                        can be brought together and you can be at peace. </para>
                    <para> The shorter practice periods for today will not be set by time, but by
                        need. You will see many problems today, each one calling for an answer. Our
                        efforts will be directed toward recognizing that there is only one problem
                        and one answer. In this recognition are all problems resolved. In this
                        recognition there is peace. </para>
                    <para> Be not deceived by the form of problems today. Whenever any difficulty
                        seems to rise, tell yourself quickly: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>Let me recognize this problem so it can be                                solved. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Then try to suspend all judgment about what the problem is. If possible,
                        close your eyes for a moment and ask what it is. You will be heard and you
                        will be answered. </para>
                </section>
                <section xml:id="L080">
                    <title>Lesson 80. Let me recognize my problems have been solved.</title>
                    <para>If you are willing to recognize your problems, you will recognize that you
                        have no problems. Your one central problem has been answered, and you have
                        no other. Therefore, you must be at peace. Salvation thus depends on
                        recognizing this one problem, and understanding that it has been solved. One
                        problem, one solution. Salvation is accomplished. Freedom from conflict has
                        been given you. Accept that fact, and you are ready to take your rightful
                        place in God's plan for salvation.</para>
                    <para> Your only problem has been solved! Repeat this over and over to yourself
                        today, with gratitude and conviction. You have recognized your only problem,
                        opening the way for the Holy Spirit to give you God's answer. You have laid
                        deception aside, and seen the light of truth. You have accepted salvation
                        for yourself by bringing the problem to the answer. And you can recognize
                        the answer, because the problem has been identified. </para>
                    <para> You are entitled to peace today. A problem that has been resolved cannot
                        trouble you. Only be certain you do not forget that all problems are the
                        same. Their many forms will not deceive you while you remember this. One
                        problem, one solution. Accept the peace this simple statement brings. </para>
                    <para> In our longer practice periods today, we will claim the peace that must
                        be ours when the problem and the answer have been brought together. The
                        problem must be gone, because God's answer cannot fail. Having recognized
                        one, you have recognized the other. The solution is inherent in the problem.
                        You are answered, and have accepted the answer. You are saved. </para>
                    <para> Now let the peace that your acceptance brings be given you. Close your
                        eyes, and receive your reward. Recognize that your problems have been
                        solved. Recognize that you are out of conflict; free and at peace. Above
                        all, remember that you have one problem, and that the problem has one
                        solution. It is in this that the simplicity of salvation lies. It is because
                        of this that it is guaranteed to work. </para>
                    <para> Assure yourself often today that your problems have been solved. Repeat
                        the idea with deep conviction, as frequently as possible. And be
                        particularly sure to apply the idea for today to any specific problem that
                        may arise. Say quickly: </para>

                        honesty. Do not deceive yourself about what the problem is, and you must

                    <title>Review II Introduction (Lessons 61 - 80)</title>
                    <para>We are now ready for another review. We will begin where our last review
                        left off, and cover two ideas each day. The earlier part of each day will be
                        devoted to one of these ideas, and the latter part of the day to the other.
                        We will have one longer exercise period, and frequent shorter ones in which
                        we practice each of them.</para>
                    <para>The longer practice periods will follow this general form: Take about
                        fifteen minutes for each of them, and begin by thinking about the ideas for
                        the day, and the comments that are included in the assignments. Devote some
                        three or four minutes to reading them over slowly, several times if you
                        wish, and then close your eyes and listen.</para>
                    <para>Repeat the first phase of the exercise period if you find your mind
                        wandering, but try to spend the major part of the time listening quietly but
                        attentively. There is a message waiting for you. Be confident that you will
                        receive it. Remember that it belongs to you, and that you want it.</para>
                    <para>Do not allow your intent to waver in the face of distracting thoughts.
                        Realize that, whatever form such thoughts may take, they have no meaning and
                        no power. Replace them with your determination to succeed. Do not forget
                        that your will has power over all fantasies and dreams. Trust it to see you
                        through, and carry you beyond them all.</para>
                    <para>Regard these practice periods as dedications to the way, the truth and the
                        life. Refuse to be sidetracked into detours, illusions and thoughts of
                        death. You are dedicated to salvation. Be determined each day not to leave
                        your function unfulfilled.</para>
                    <para>Reaffirm your determination in the shorter practice periods as well, using
                        the original form of the idea for general applications, and more specific
                        forms when needed. Some specific forms are included in the comments which
                        follow the statement of the ideas. These, however, are merely suggestions.
                        It is not the particular words you use that matter.</para>

                            <para>It is through accepting my function that I will see the light in
                                me. And in this light will my function stand clear and perfectly
                                unambiguous before my sight. My acceptance does not depend on my

                                forgiveness. Yet I will trust that, in the light, I will see it as

                                    The light of the world brings peace to every mind through my forgiveness.</para>
                                <para>My forgiveness is the means by which the light of the world
                                    finds expression through me. My forgiveness is the means by
                                    which I become aware of the light of the world in me. My
                                    forgiveness is the means by which the world is healed, together
                                    with myself. Let me, then, forgive the world, that it may be
                                    healed along with me.</para>

                                    fulfill my function, I will not experience the joy that God

                                    what to do, what to say and what to think. All doubt must

                                    happiness because both come from the same Source. And I must
                                    learn to recognize what makes me happy, if I would find

                                    Only God's plan for salvation will                                        work.</para>
                                <para>It is senseless for me to search wildly about for salvation. I
                                    have seen it in many people and in many things, but when I
                                    reached for it, it was not there. I was mistaken about where it
                                    is. I was mistaken about what it is. I will undertake no more
                                    idle seeking. Only God's plan for salvation will work. And I
                                    will rejoice because His plan can never fail. </para>
                                <para>These are some suggested forms for applying this idea

                                            salvation. Let me perceive this only in the light of
                                            God's plan for salvation. </para>

                                    Holding grievances is an attack on God's                                        plan for salvation.</para>
                                <para>Holding grievances is an attempt to prove that God's plan for
                                    salvation will not work. Yet only His plan will work. By holding
                                    grievances, I am therefore excluding my only hope of salvation
                                    from my awareness. I would no longer defeat my own best
                                    interests in this insane way. I would accept God's plan for
                                    salvation, and be happy. </para>

                                            this. If I see grounds
                                            for grievances in this, I will not see the grounds for
                                            my salvation. This calls for salvation, not attack.

                                <para>I will use the power of my will today. It is not my will to
                                    grope about in darkness, fearful of shadows and afraid of things
                                    unseen and unreal. Light shall be my guide today. I will follow
                                    it where it leads me, and I will look only on what it shows me.
                                    This day I will experience the peace of true perception. </para>

                                <para>I am safe today because there is no will but God's. I can
                                    become afraid only when I believe there is another will. I try
                                    to attack only when I am afraid, and only when I try to attack
                                    can I believe that my eternal safety is threatened. Today I will
                                    recognize that all this has not occurred. I am safe because
                                    there is no will but God's. </para>

                                <para>In choosing salvation rather than attack, I merely choose to
                                    recognize what is already there. Salvation is a decision made
                                    already. Attack and grievances are not there to choose. That is
                                    why I always choose between truth and illusion; between what is
                                    there and what is not. The light has come. I can but choose the
                                    light, for it has no alternative. It has replaced the darkness,
                                    and the darkness has gone. </para>

                                <para>Here is the perfect statement of my freedom. I am under no
                                    laws but God's. I am constantly tempted to make up other laws
                                    and give them power over me. I suffer only because of my belief
                                    in them. They have no real effect on me at all. I am perfectly
                                    free of the effects of all laws save God's. And His are the laws
                                    of freedom. </para>

                                <para>I am entitled to miracles because I am under no laws but
                                    God's. His laws release me from all grievances, and replace them
                                    with miracles. And I would accept the miracles in place of the
                                    grievances, which are but illusions that hide the miracles
                                    beyond. Now I would accept only what the laws of God entitle me
                                    to have, that I may use it on behalf of the function He has
                                    given me. </para>

                                <para>By this idea do I unite my will with the Holy Spirit's, and

                                    hell. By this idea do I express my willingness to have all my

                                    salvation. I would make no exceptions and no substitutes. I want

                                    Let me recognize the problem so it can be                                        solved.</para>
                                <para>Let me realize today that the problem is always some form of
                                    grievance that I would cherish. Let me also understand that the
                                    solution is always a miracle with which I let the grievance be
                                    replaced. Today I would remember the simplicity of salvation by
                                    reinforcing the lesson that there is one problem and one
                                    solution. The problem is a grievance; the solution is a miracle.
                                    And I invite the solution to come to me through my forgiveness
                                    of the grievance, and my welcome of the miracle that takes its
                                    place. </para>

                                <para>I seem to have problems only because I am misusing time. I
                                    believe that the problem comes first, and time must elapse
                                    before it can be worked out. I do not see the problem and the
                                    answer as simultaneous in their occurrence. That is because I do
                                    not yet realize that God has placed the answer together with the
                                    problem, so that they cannot be separated by time. The Holy
                                    Spirit will teach me this, if I will let Him. And I will
                                    understand it is impossible that I could have a problem which
                                    has not been solved already. </para>

                    <title>Lesson 91. Miracles are seen in light.</title>
                    <para>It is important to remember that miracles and vision necessarily go
                        together. This needs repeating, and frequent repeating. It is a central idea
                        in your new thought system, and the perception that it produces. The miracle
                        is always there. Its presence is not caused by your vision; its absence is
                        not the result of your failure to see. It is only your awareness of miracles
                        that is affected. You will see them in the light; you will not see them in
                        the dark.</para>
                    <para> To you, then, light is crucial. While you remain in darkness, the miracle
                        remains unseen. Thus you are convinced it is not there. This follows from
                        the premises from which the darkness comes. Denial of light leads to failure
                        to perceive it. Failure to perceive light is to perceive darkness. The light
                        is useless to you then, even though it is there. You cannot use it because
                        its presence is unknown to you. And the seeming reality of the darkness
                        makes the idea of light meaningless. </para>
                    <para> To be told that what you do not see is there sounds like insanity. It is
                        very difficult to become convinced that it is insanity not to see what is
                        there, and to see what is not there instead. You do not doubt that the
                        body's eyes can see. You do not doubt the images they show you are reality.
                        Your faith lies in the darkness, not the light. How can this be reversed?
                        For you it is impossible, but you are not alone in this. </para>
                    <para> Your efforts, however little they may be, have strong support. Did you
                        but realize how great this strength, your doubts would vanish. Today we will
                        devote ourselves to the attempt to let you feel this strength. When you have
                        felt the strength in you, which makes all miracles within your easy reach,
                        you will not doubt. The miracles your sense of weakness hides will leap into
                        awareness as you feel the strength in you. </para>
                    <para> Three times today, set aside about ten minutes for a quiet time in which
                        you try to leave your weakness behind. This is accomplished very simply, as
                        you instruct yourself that you are not a body. Faith goes to what you want,
                        and you instruct your mind accordingly. Your will remains your teacher, and
                        your will has all the strength to do what it desires. You can escape the
                        body if you choose. You can experience the strength in you. </para>
                    <para> Begin the longer practice periods with this statement of true cause and
                        effect relationships: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>Miracles are seen in light. The body's eyes do
                                not perceive the light. But I am not a body. What am I?
                            </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>The question with which this statement ends is needed for our exercises
                        today. What you think you are is a belief to be undone. But what you really
                        are must be revealed to you. The belief you are a body calls for correction,
                        being a mistake. 0 The truth of what you are calls on the strength in you to
                        bring to your awareness what the mistake conceals. </para>
                    <para> If you are not a body, what are you? You need to be aware of what the
                        Holy Spirit uses to replace the image of a body in your mind. You need to
                        feel something to put your faith in, as you lift it from the body. You need
                        a real experience of something else, something more solid and more sure;
                        more worthy of your faith, and really there. </para>
                    <para> If you are not a body, what are you? Ask this in honesty, and then devote
                        several minutes to allowing your mistaken thoughts about your attributes to
                        be corrected, and their opposites to take their place. Say, for example: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>I am not weak, but strong. I am not helpless,
                                but all powerful. I am not limited, but unlimited. I am not
                                doubtful, but certain. I am not an illusion, but a reality. I cannot
                                see in darkness, but in light. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para> In the second phase of the exercise period, try to experience these
                        truths about yourself. Concentrate particularly on the experience of
                        strength. Remember that all sense of weakness is associated with the belief
                        you are a body, a belief that is mistaken and deserves no faith. Try to
                        remove your faith from it, if only for a moment. You will be accustomed to
                        keeping faith with the more worthy in you as we go along. </para>
                    <para> Relax for the rest of the practice period, confident that your efforts,
                        however meager, are fully supported by the strength of God and all His
                        Thoughts. It is from Them that your strength will come. It is through Their
                        strong support that you will feel the strength in you. They are united with
                        you in this practice period, in which you share a purpose like Their Own.
                        Theirs is the light in which you will see miracles, because Their strength
                        is yours. Their strength becomes your eyes, that you may see. </para>
                    <para> Five or six times an hour, at reasonably regular intervals, remind
                        yourself that miracles are seen in light. Also, be sure to meet temptation
                        with today's idea. This form would be helpful for this special purpose: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>Miracles are seen in light. Let me not close                                my eyes because of this. </para>

                    <title>Lesson 92. Miracles are seen in light, and light and strength are
                        one.</title>
                    <para>The idea for today is an extension of the previous one. You do not think
                        of light in terms of strength, and darkness in terms of weakness. That is
                        because your idea of what seeing means is tied up with the body and its eyes
                        and brain. Thus you believe that you can change what you see by putting
                        little bits of glass before your eyes. This is among the many magical
                        beliefs that come from the conviction you are a body, and the body's eyes
                        can see.</para>
                    <para> You also believe the body's brain can think. If you but understood the
                        nature of thought, you could but laugh at this insane idea. It is as if you
                        thought you held the match that lights the sun and gives it all its warmth;
                        or that you held the world within your hand, securely bound until you let it
                        go. Yet this is no more foolish than to believe the body's eyes can see; the
                        brain can think. </para>
                    <para> It is God's strength in you that is the light in which you see, as it is
                        His Mind with which you think. His strength denies your weakness. It is your
                        weakness that sees through the body's eyes, peering about in darkness to
                        behold the likeness of itself; the small, the weak, the sickly and the
                        dying, those in need, the helpless and afraid, the sad, the poor, the
                        starving and the joyless. These are seen through eyes that cannot see and
                        cannot bless. </para>
                    <para> Strength overlooks these things by seeing past appearances. It keeps its
                        steady gaze upon the light that lies beyond them. It unites with light, of
                        which it is a part. It sees itself. It brings the light in which your Self
                        appears. In darkness you perceive a self that is not there. Strength is the
                        truth about you; weakness is an idol falsely worshipped and adored that
                        strength may be dispelled, and darkness rule where God appointed that there
                        should be light. </para>
                    <para> Strength comes from truth, and shines with light its Source has given it;
                        weakness reflects the darkness of its maker. It is sick and looks on
                        sickness, which is like itself. Truth is a savior and can only will for
                        happiness and peace for everyone. It gives its strength to everyone who
                        asks, in limitless supply. It sees that lack in anyone would be a lack in
                        all. And so it gives its light that all may see and benefit as one. Its
                        strength is shared, that it may bring to all the miracle in which they will
                        unite in purpose and forgiveness and in love. </para>
                    <para> Weakness, which looks in darkness, cannot see a purpose in forgiveness
                        and in love. It sees all others different from itself, and nothing in the
                        world that it would share. It judges and condemns, but does not love. In
                        darkness it remains to hide itself, and dreams that it is strong and
                        conquering, a victor over limitations that but grow in darkness to enormous
                        size. </para>
                    <para> It fears and it attacks and hates itself, and darkness covers everything
                        it sees, leaving its dreams as fearful as itself. No miracles are here, but
                        only hate. It separates itself from what it sees, while light and strength
                        perceive themselves as one. The light of strength is not the light you see.
                        It does not change and flicker and go out. It does not shift from night to
                        day, and back to darkness till the morning comes again. </para>
                    <para> The light of strength is constant, sure as love, forever glad to give
                        itself away, because it cannot give but to itself. No one can ask in vain to
                        share its sight, and none who enters its abode can leave without a miracle
                        before his eyes, and strength and light abiding in his heart. </para>
                    <para> The strength in you will offer you the light, and guide your seeing so
                        you do not dwell on idle shadows that the body's eyes provide for
                        self-deception. Strength and light unite in you, and where they meet, your
                        Self stands ready to embrace you as Its Own. Such is the meeting place we
                        try today to find and rest in, for the peace of God is where your Self, His
                        Son, is waiting now to meet Itself again, and be as One. </para>
                    <para> Let us give twenty minutes twice today to join this meeting. Let yourself
                        be brought unto your Self. Its strength will be the light in which the gift
                        of sight is given you. Leave, then, the dark a little while today, and we
                        will practice seeing in the light, closing the body's eyes and asking truth
                        to show us how to find the meeting place of self and Self, where light and
                        strength are one. </para>
                    <para> Morning and evening we will practice thus. After the morning meeting, we
                        will use the day in preparation for the time at night when we will meet
                        again in trust. Let us repeat as often as we can the idea for today, and
                        recognize that we are being introduced to sight, and led away from darkness

                    <para>You think you are the home of evil, darkness and sin. You think if anyone
                        could see the truth about you he would be repelled, recoiling from you as if
                        from a poisonous snake. You think if what is true about you were revealed to
                        you, you would be struck with horror so intense that you would rush to death
                        by your own hand, living on after seeing this being impossible.</para>
                    <para> These are beliefs so firmly fixed that it is difficult to help you see
                        that they are based on nothing. That you have made mistakes is obvious. That
                        you have sought salvation in strange ways; have been deceived, deceiving and
                        afraid of foolish fantasies and savage dreams; and have bowed down to idols
                        made of dust,–all this is true by what you now believe. </para>
                    <para> Today we question this, not from the point of view of what you think, but
                        from a very different reference point, from which such idle thoughts are
                        meaningless. These thoughts are not according to God's Will. These weird
                        beliefs He does not share with you. This is enough to prove that they are
                        wrong, but you do not perceive that this is so. </para>
                    <para> Why would you not be overjoyed to be assured that all the evil that you
                        think you did was never done, that all your sins are nothing, that you are
                        as pure and holy as you were created, and that light and joy and peace abide
                        in you? Your image of yourself cannot withstand the Will of God. You think
                        that this is death, but it is life. You think you are destroyed, but you are
                        saved. </para>
                    <para> The self you made is not the Son of God. Therefore, this self does not
                        exist at all. And anything it seems to do and think means nothing. It is
                        neither bad nor good. It is unreal, and nothing more than that. It does not
                        battle with the Son of God. It does not hurt him, nor attack his peace. It
                        has not changed creation, nor reduced eternal sinlessness to sin, and love
                        to hate. What power can this self you made possess, when it would contradict
                        the Will of God? </para>
                    <para> Your sinlessness is guaranteed by God. Over and over this must be
                        repeated, until it is accepted. It is true. Your sinlessness is guaranteed
                        by God. Nothing can touch it, or change what God created as eternal. The
                        self you made, evil and full of sin, is meaningless. Your sinlessness is
                        guaranteed by God, and light and joy and peace abide in you. </para>
                    <para> Salvation requires the acceptance of but one thought;–you are as God
                        created you, not what you made of yourself. Whatever evil you may think you
                        did, you are as God created you. Whatever mistakes you made, the truth about
                        you is unchanged. Creation is eternal and unalterable. Your sinlessness is
                        guaranteed by God. You are and will forever be exactly as you were created.
                        Light and joy and peace abide in you because God put them there. </para>
                    <para> In our longer exercise periods today, which would be most profitable if
                        done for the first five minutes of every waking hour, begin by stating the
                        truth about your creation: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>Light and joy and peace abide in me. My                                sinlessness is guaranteed by God. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Then put away your foolish self-images, and spend the rest of the practice
                        period in trying to experience what God has given you, in place of what you
                        have decreed for yourself. </para>
                    <para> You are what God created or what you made. One Self is true; the other is
                        not there. Try to experience the unity of your one Self. Try to appreciate
                        Its Holiness and the love from which It was created. Try not to interfere
                        with the Self which God created as you, by hiding Its majesty behind the
                        tiny idols of evil and sinfulness you have made to replace It. Let It come
                        into Its Own. Here you are; This is You. And light and joy and peace abide
                        in you because this is so. </para>
                    <para> You may not be willing or even able to use the first five minutes of each
                        hour for these exercises. Try, however, to do so when you can. At least
                        remember to repeat these thoughts each hour: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>Light and joy and peace abide in                                me.My sinlessness is guaranteed                                by God. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Then try to devote at least a minute or so to closing your eyes and
                        realizing that this is a statement of the truth about you. </para>
                    <para> If a situation arises that seems to be disturbing, quickly dispel the
                        illusion of fear by repeating these thoughts again. Should you be tempted to
                        become angry with someone, tell him silently: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>Light and joy and peace abide in                                you.Your sinlessness is                                guaranteed by God. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>You can do much for the world's salvation today. You can do much today to
                        bring you closer to the part in salvation that God has assigned to you. And
                        you can do much today to bring the conviction to your mind that the idea for
                        the day is true indeed. </para>

                    <para>Today we continue with the one idea which brings complete salvation; the
                        one statement which makes all forms of temptation powerless; the one thought
                        which renders the ego silent and entirely undone. You are as God created
                        you. The sounds of this world are still, the sights of this world disappear,
                        and all the thoughts that this world ever held are wiped away forever by
                        this one idea. Here is salvation accomplished. Here is sanity
                        restored.</para>
                    <para> True light is strength, and strength is sinlessness. If you remain as God
                        created you, you must be strong and light must be in you. He Who ensured
                        your sinlessness must be the guarantee of strength and light as well. You
                        are as God created you. Darkness cannot obscure the glory of God's Son. You
                        stand in light, strong in the sinlessness in which you were created, and in
                        which you will remain throughout eternity. </para>
                    <para> Today we will again devote the first five minutes of each waking hour to
                        the attempt to feel the truth in you. Begin these times of searching with
                        these words: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>I am as God created me. I am His Son eternally. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Now try to reach the Son of God in you. This is the Self that never
                        sinned, nor made an image to replace reality. This is the Self that never
                        left Its home in God to walk the world uncertainly. This is the Self that
                        knows no fear, nor could conceive of loss or suffering or death. </para>
                    <para> Nothing is required of you to reach this goal except to lay all idols and
                        self-images aside; go past the list of attributes, both good and bad, you
                        have ascribed to yourself; and wait in silent expectancy for the truth. God
                        has Himself promised that it will be revealed to all who ask for it. You are
                        asking now. You cannot fail because He cannot fail. </para>
                    <para> If you do not meet the requirement of practicing for the first five
                        minutes of every hour, at least remind yourself hourly: </para>

                    <para>Tell yourself frequently today that you are as God created you. And be
                        sure to respond to anyone who seems to irritate you with these words: </para>

                        be a giant stride toward your release, and a milestone in learning the

                    <title>Lesson 95. I am one Self, united with my Creator.</title>
                    <para>Today's idea accurately describes you as God created you. You are one
                        within yourself, and one with Him. Yours is the unity of all creation. Your
                        perfect unity makes change in you impossible. You do not accept this, and
                        you fail to realize it must be so, only because you believe that you have
                        changed yourself already.</para>
                    <para> You see yourself as a ridiculous parody on God's creation; weak, vicious,
                        ugly and sinful, miserable and beset with pain. Such is your version of
                        yourself; a self divided into many warring parts, separate from God, and
                        tenuously held together by its erratic and capricious maker, to which you
                        pray. It does not hear your prayers, for it is deaf. It does not see the
                        oneness in you, for it is blind. It does not understand you are the Son of
                        God, for it is senseless and understands nothing. </para>
                    <para> We will attempt today to be aware only of what can hear and see, and what
                        makes perfect sense. We will again direct our exercises towards reaching
                        your one Self, which is united with Its Creator. In patience and in hope we
                        try again today. </para>
                    <para> The use of the first five minutes of every waking hour for practicing the
                        idea for the day has special advantages at the stage of learning in which
                        you are at present. It is difficult at this point not to allow your mind to
                        wander, if it undertakes extended practice. You have surely realized this by
                        now. You have seen the extent of your lack of mental discipline, and of your
                        need for mind training. It is necessary that you be aware of this, for it is
                        indeed a hindrance to your advance. </para>
                    <para> Frequent but shorter practice periods have other advantages for you at
                        this time. In addition to recognizing your difficulties with sustained
                        attention, you must also have noticed that, unless you are reminded of your
                        purpose frequently, you tend to forget about it for long periods of time.
                        You often fail to remember the short applications of the idea for the day,
                        and you have not yet formed the habit of using the idea as an automatic
                        response to temptation. </para>
                    <para> Structure, then, is necessary for you at this time, planned to include
                        frequent reminders of your goal and regular attempts to reach it. Regularity
                        in terms of time is not the ideal requirement for the most beneficial form
                        of practice in salvation. It is advantageous, however, for those whose
                        motivation is inconsistent, and who remain heavily defended against
                        learning. </para>
                    <para> We will, therefore, keep to the five-minutes-an-hour practice periods for
                        a while, and urge you to omit as few as possible. Using the first five
                        minutes of the hour will be particularly helpful, since it imposes firmer
                        structure. Do not, however, use your lapses from this schedule as an excuse
                        not to return to it again as soon as you can. There may well be a temptation
                        to regard the day as lost because you have already failed to do what is
                        required. This should, however, merely be recognized as what it is; a
                        refusal to let your mistake be corrected, and an unwillingness to try again. </para>
                    <para> The Holy Spirit is not delayed in His teaching by your mistakes. He can
                        be held back only by your unwillingness to let them go. Let us therefore be
                        determined, particularly for the next week or so, to be willing to forgive
                        ourselves for our lapses in diligence, and our failures to follow the
                        instructions for practicing the day's idea. This tolerance for weakness will
                        enable us to overlook it, rather than give it power to delay our learning.
                        If we give it power to do this, we are regarding it as strength, and are
                        confusing strength with weakness. </para>
                    <para> When you fail to comply with the requirements of this course, you have
                        merely made a mistake. This calls for correction, and for nothing else. To
                        allow a mistake to continue is to make additional mistakes, based on the
                        first and reinforcing it. It is this process that must be laid aside, for it
                        is but another way in which you would defend illusions against the truth. </para>
                    <para> Let all these errors go by recognizing them for what they are. They are
                        attempts to keep you unaware you are one Self, united with your Creator, at
                        one with every aspect of creation, and limitless in power and in peace. This
                        is the truth, and nothing else is true. Today we will affirm this truth
                        again, and try to reach the place in you in which there is no doubt that
                        only this is true. </para>
                    <para> Begin the practice periods today with this assurance, offered to your
                        mind with all the certainty that you can give: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>I am one Self, united with my Creator, at one
                                with every aspect of creation, and limitless in power and in peace.
                            </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Then close your eyes and tell yourself again, slowly and thoughtfully,
                        attempting to allow the meaning of the words to sink into your mind,
                        replacing false ideas: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>I am one Self. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Repeat this several times, and then attempt to feel the meaning that the
                        words convey. </para>
                    <para> You are one Self, united and secure in light and joy and peace. You are
                        God's Son, one Self, with one Creator and one goal; to bring awareness of
                        this oneness to all minds, that true creation may extend the allness and the
                        unity of God. You are one Self, complete and healed and whole, with power to
                        lift the veil of darkness from the world, and let the light in you come

                    <para> You are one Self, in perfect harmony with all there is, and all that
                        there will be. You are one Self, the holy Son of God, united with your
                        brothers in that Self; united with your Father in His Will. Feel this one
                        Self in you, and let It shine away all your illusions and your doubts. This
                        is your Self, the Son of God Himself, sinless as Its Creator, with His
                        strength within you and His Love forever yours. You are one Self, and it is
                        given you to feel this Self within you, and to cast all your illusions out
                        of the one Mind that is this Self, the holy truth in you. </para>
                    <para> Do not forget today. We need your help; your little part in bringing
                        happiness to all the world. And Heaven looks to you in confidence that you
                        will try today. Share, then, its surety, for it is yours. Be vigilant. Do
                        not forget today. Throughout the day do not forget your goal. Repeat today's
                        idea as frequently as possible, and understand each time you do so, someone
                        hears the voice of hope, the stirring of the truth within his mind, the
                        gentle rustling of the wings of peace. </para>
                    <para> Your own acknowledgment you are one Self, united with your Father, is a
                        call to all the world to be at one with you. To everyone you meet today, be
                        sure to give the promise of today's idea and tell him this: </para>

                    <title>Lesson 96. Salvation comes from my one Self.</title>
                    <para>Although you are one Self, you experience yourself as two; as both good
                        and evil, loving and hating, mind and body. This sense of being split into
                        opposites induces feelings of acute and constant conflict, and leads to
                        frantic attempts to reconcile the contradictory aspects of this
                        selfperception. You have sought many such solutions, and none of them has
                        worked. The opposites you see in you will never be compatible. But one
                        exists.</para>
                    <para> The fact that truth and illusion cannot be reconciled, no matter how you
                        try, what means you use and where you see the problem, must be accepted if
                        you would be saved. Until you have accepted this, you will attempt an
                        endless list of goals you cannot reach; a senseless series of expenditures
                        of time and effort, hopefulness and doubt, each one as futile as the one
                        before, and failing as the next one surely will. </para>
                    <para> Problems that have no meaning cannot be resolved within the framework
                        they are set. Two selves in conflict could not be resolved, and good and
                        evil have no meeting place. The self you made can never be your Self, nor
                        can your Self be split in two, and still be what It is and must forever be.
                        A mind and body cannot both exist. Make no attempt to reconcile the two, for
                        one denies the other can be real. If you are physical, your mind is gone
                        from your self-concept, for it has no place in which it could be really part
                        of you. If you are spirit, then the body must be meaningless to your
                        reality. </para>
                    <para> Spirit makes use of mind as means to find its Self expression. And the
                        mind which serves the spirit is at peace and filled with joy. Its power
                        comes from spirit, and it is fulfilling happily its function here. Yet mind
                        can also see itself divorced from spirit, and perceive itself within a body
                        it confuses with itself. Without its function then it has no peace, and
                        happiness is alien to its thoughts. </para>
                    <para> Yet mind apart from spirit cannot think. It has denied its Source of
                        strength, and sees itself as helpless, limited and weak. Dissociated from
                        its function now, it thinks it is alone and separate, attacked by armies
                        massed against itself and hiding in the body's frail support. Now must it
                        reconcile unlike with like, for this is what it thinks that it is for. </para>
                    <para> Waste no more time on this. Who can resolve the senseless conflicts which
                        a dream presents? What could the resolution mean in truth? What purpose
                        could it serve? What is it for? Salvation cannot make illusions real, nor
                        solve a problem that does not exist. Perhaps you hope it can. Yet would you
                        have God's plan for the release of His dear Son bring pain to him, and fail
                        to set him free? </para>
                    <para> Your Self retains Its Thoughts, and they remain within your mind and in
                        the Mind of God. The Holy Spirit holds salvation in your mind, and offers it
                        the way to peace. Salvation is a thought you share with God, because His
                        Voice accepted it for you and answered in your name that it was done. Thus
                        is salvation kept among the Thoughts your Self holds dear and cherishes for
                        you. </para>
                    <para> We will attempt today to find this thought, whose presence in your mind
                        is guaranteed by Him Who speaks to you from your one Self. Our hourly
                        five-minute practicing will be a search for Him within your mind. Salvation
                        comes from this one Self through Him Who is the Bridge between your mind and
                        It. Wait patiently, and let Him speak to you about your Self, and what your
                        mind can do, restored to It and free to serve Its Will. </para>
                    <para> Begin with saying this: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>Salvation comes from my one Self. Its Thoughts                                are mine to use. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Then seek Its Thoughts, and claim them as your own. These are your own
                        real thoughts you have denied, and let your mind go wandering in a world of
                        dreams, to find illusions in their place. Here are your thoughts, the only
                        ones you have. Salvation is among them; find it there. </para>
                    <para> If you succeed, the thoughts that come to you will tell you you are
                        saved, and that your mind has found the function that it sought to lose.
                        Your Self will welcome it and give it peace. Restored in strength, it will
                        again flow out from spirit to the spirit in all things created by the Spirit
                        as Itself. Your mind will bless all things. Confusion done, you are
                        restored, for you have found your Self. </para>
                    <para> Your Self knows that you cannot fail today. Perhaps your mind remains
                        uncertain yet a little while. Be not dismayed by this. The joy your Self
                        experiences It will save for you, and it will yet be yours in full
                        awareness. Every time you spend five minutes of the hour seeking Him Who
                        joins your mind and Self, you offer Him another treasure to be kept for you. </para>
                    <para> Each time today you tell your frantic mind salvation comes from your one
                        Self, you lay another treasure in your growing store. And all of it is given
                        everyone who asks for it, and will accept the gift. Think, then, how much is
                        given unto you to give this day, that it be given you! </para>

                    <title>Lesson 97. I am spirit.</title>
                    <para>Today's idea identifies you with your one Self. It accepts no split
                        identity, nor tries to weave opposing factors into unity. It simply states
                        the truth. Practice this truth today as often as you can, for it will bring
                        your mind from conflict to the quiet fields of peace. No chill of fear can
                        enter, for your mind has been absolved from madness, letting go illusions of
                        a split identity.</para>
                    <para> We state again the truth about your Self, the holy Son of God Who rests
                        in you; whose mind has been restored to sanity. You are the spirit lovingly
                        endowed with all your Father's Love and peace and joy. You are the spirit
                        which completes Himself, and shares His function as Creator. He is with you
                        always, as you are with Him. </para>
                    <para> Today we try to bring reality still closer to your mind. Each time you
                        practice, awareness is brought a little nearer at least; sometimes a
                        thousand years or more are saved. The minutes which you give are multiplied
                        over and over, for the miracle makes use of time, but is not ruled by it.
                        Salvation is a miracle, the first and last; the first that is the last, for
                        it is one. </para>
                    <para> You are the spirit in whose mind abides the miracle in which all time
                        stands still; the miracle in which a minute spent in using these ideas
                        becomes a time that has no limit and that has no end. Give, then, these
                        minutes willingly, and count on Him Who promised to lay timelessness beside
                        them. He will offer all His strength to every little effort that you make.
                        Give Him the minutes which He needs today, to help you understand with Him
                        you are the spirit that abides in Him, and that calls through His Voice to
                        every living thing; offers His sight to everyone who asks; replaces error
                        with the simple truth. </para>
                    <para> The Holy Spirit will be glad to take five minutes of each hour from your
                        hands, and carry them around this aching world where pain and misery appear
                        to rule. He will not overlook one open mind that will accept the healing
                        gifts they bring, and He will lay them everywhere He knows they will be
                        welcome. And they will increase in healing power each time someone accepts
                        them as his thoughts, and uses them to heal. </para>
                    <para> Thus will each gift to Him be multiplied a thousandfold and tens of
                        thousands more. And when it is returned to you, it will surpass in might the
                        little gift you gave as much as does the radiance of the sun outshine the
                        tiny gleam a firefly makes an uncertain moment and goes out. The steady
                        brilliance of this light remains and leads you out of darkness, nor will you
                        be able to forget the way again. </para>
                    <para> Begin these happy exercises with the words the Holy Spirit speaks to you,
                        and let them echo round the world through Him: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>Spirit am I, a holy Son of God, free of all
                                limits, safe and healed and whole, free to forgive, and free to save
                                the world. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Expressed through you, the Holy Spirit will accept this gift that you
                        received of Him, increase its power and give it back to you. </para>
                    <para> Offer each practice period today gladly to Him. And He will speak to you,
                        reminding you that you are spirit, one with Him and God, your brothers and
                        your Self. Listen for His assurance every time you speak the words He offers
                        you today, and let Him tell your mind that they are true. Use them against
                        temptation, and escape its sorry consequences if you yield to the belief
                        that you are something else. The Holy Spirit gives you peace today. Receive
                        His words, and offer them to Him. </para>

                    <para>Today is a day of special dedication. We take a stand on but one side
                        today. We side with truth and let illusions go. We will not vacillate
                        between the two, but take a firm position with the One. We dedicate
                        ourselves to truth today, and to salvation as God planned it be. We will not
                        argue it is something else. We will not seek for it where it is not. In
                        gladness we accept it as it is, and take the part assigned to us by

                        surety has come. We have a mighty purpose to fulfill, and have been given
                        everything we need with which to reach the goal. Not one mistake stands in
                        our way. For we have been absolved from errors. All our sins are washed away

                        them to do. They do not doubt their own ability because they know their
                        function will be filled completely in the perfect time and place. They took
                        the stand which we will take today, that we may share their certainty and

                        and answer it when they have come to make their choice again. We do not
                        choose but for ourselves today. </para>

                    <title>Lesson 99. Salvation is my only function here.</title>
                    <para>Salvation and forgiveness are the same. They both imply that something has
                        gone wrong; something to be saved from, forgiven for; something amiss that
                        needs corrective change; something apart or different from the Will of God.
                        Thus do both terms imply a thing impossible but yet which has occurred,
                        resulting in a state of conflict seen between what is and what could never
                        be.</para>
                    <para> Truth and illusions both are equal now, for both have happened. The
                        impossible becomes the thing you need forgiveness for, salvation from.
                        Salvation now becomes the borderland between the truth and the illusion. It
                        reflects the truth because it is the means by which you can escape
                        illusions. Yet it is not yet the truth because it undoes what was never
                        done. </para>
                    <para> How could there be a meeting place at all where earth and Heaven can be
                        reconciled within a mind where both of them exist? The mind that sees
                        illusions thinks them real. They have existence in that they are thoughts.
                        And yet they are not real, because the mind that thinks these thoughts is
                        separate from God. </para>
                    <para> What joins the separated mind and thoughts with Mind and Thought which
                        are forever One? What plan could hold the truth inviolate, yet recognize the
                        need illusions bring, and offer means by which they are undone without
                        attack and with no touch of pain? What but a Thought of God could be this
                        plan, by which the never done is overlooked, and sins forgotten which were
                        never real? </para>
                    <para> The Holy Spirit holds this plan of God exactly as it was received of Him
                        within the Mind of God and in your own. It is apart from time in that its
                        Source is timeless. Yet it operates in time, because of your belief that
                        time is real. Unshaken does the Holy Spirit look on what you see; on sin and
                        pain and death, on grief and separation and on loss. Yet does He know one
                        thing must still be true; God is still Love, and this is not His Will. </para>
                    <para> This is the Thought that brings illusions to the truth, and sees them as
                        appearances behind which is the changeless and the sure. This is the Thought
                        that saves and that forgives, because it lays no faith in what is not
                        created by the only Source it knows. This is the Thought whose function is
                        to save by giving you its function as your own. Salvation is your function,
                        with the One to Whom the plan was given. Now are you entrusted with this
                        plan, along with Him. He has one answer to appearances; regardless of their
                        form, their size, their depth or any attribute they seem to have: </para>

                    <para> You who will yet work miracles, be sure you practice well the idea for
                        today. Try to perceive the strength in what you say, for these are words in
                        which your freedom lies. Your Father loves you. All the world of pain is not
                        His Will. Forgive yourself the thought He wanted this for you. Then let the
                        Thought with which He has replaced all your mistakes enter the darkened
                        places of your mind that thought the thoughts that never were His Will. </para>
                    <para> This part belongs to God, as does the rest. It does not think its
                        solitary thoughts, and make them real by hiding them from Him. Let in the
                        light, and you will look upon no obstacle to what He wills for you. Open
                        your secrets to His kindly light, and see how bright this light still shines
                        in you. </para>
                    <para> Practice His Thought today, and let His light seek out and lighten up all
                        darkened spots, and shine through them to join them to the rest. It is God's
                        Will your mind be one with His. It is God's Will that He has but one Son. It
                        is God's Will that His one Son is you. Think of these things in practicing
                        today, and start the lesson that we learn today with this instruction in the
                        way of truth: </para>

                    <para>Just as God's Son completes his Father, so your part in it completes your
                        Father's plan. Salvation must reverse the mad belief in separate thoughts
                        and separate bodies, which lead separate lives and go their separate ways.
                        One function shared by separate minds unites them in one purpose, for each
                        one of them is equally essential to them all.</para>
                    <para> God's Will for you is perfect happiness. Why should you choose to go
                        against His Will? The part that He has saved for you to take in working out
                        His plan is given you that you might be restored to what He wills. This part
                        is as essential to His plan as to your happiness. Your joy must be complete
                        to let His plan be understood by those to whom He sends you. They will see
                        their function in your shining face, and hear God calling to them in your
                        happy laugh. </para>
                    <para> You are indeed essential to God's plan. Without your joy, His joy is
                        incomplete. Without your smile, the world cannot be saved. While you are
                        sad, the light that God Himself appointed as the means to save the world is
                        dim and lusterless, and no one laughs because all laughter can but echo
                        yours. </para>
                    <para>You are indeed essential to God's plan. Just as your light increases every
                        light that shines in Heaven, so your joy on earth calls to all minds to let
                        their sorrows go, and take their place beside you in God's plan. God's
                        messengers are joyous, and their joy heals sorrow and despair. They are the
                        proof that God wills perfect happiness for all who will accept their
                        Father's gifts as theirs. </para>
                    <para>We will not let ourselves be sad today. For if we do, we fail to take the
                        part that is essential to God's plan, as well as to our vision. Sadness is
                        the sign that you would play another part, instead of what has been assigned
                        to you by God. Thus do you fail to show the world how great the happiness He
                        wills for you. And so you do not recognize that it is yours. </para>
                    <para> Today we will attempt to understand joy is our function here. If you are
                        sad, your part is unfulfilled, and all the world is thus deprived of joy,
                        along with you. God asks you to be happy, so the world can see how much He
                        loves His Son, and wills no sorrow rises to abate his joy; no fear besets
                        him to disturb his peace. You are God's messenger today. You bring His
                        happiness to all you look upon; His peace to everyone who looks on you and
                        sees His message in your happy face. </para>
                    <para> We will prepare ourselves for this today, in our five-minute practice
                        periods, by feeling happiness arise in us according to our Father's Will and
                        ours. Begin the exercises with the thought today's idea contains. Then
                        realize your part is to be happy. Only this is asked of you or anyone who
                        wants to take his place among God's messengers. Think what this means. You
                        have indeed been wrong in your belief that sacrifice is asked. You but
                        receive according to God's plan, and never lose or sacrifice or die. </para>
                    <para> Now let us try to find that joy that proves to us and all the world God's
                        Will for us. It is your function that you find it here, and that you find it
                        now. For this you came. Let this one be the day that you succeed! Look deep
                        within you, undismayed by all the little thoughts and foolish goals you pass
                        as you ascend to meet the Christ in you. </para>
                    <para> He will be there. And you can reach Him now. What could you rather look
                        upon in place of Him Who waits that you may look on Him? What little thought
                        has power to hold you back? What foolish goal can keep you from success when
                        He Who calls to you is God Himself? </para>
                    <para> He will be there. You are essential to His plan. You are His messenger
                        today. And you must find what He would have you give. Do not forget the idea
                        for today between your hourly practice periods. It is your Self Who calls to
                        you today. And it is Him you answer, every time you tell yourself you are
                        essential to God's plan for the salvation of the world. </para>

                    <title>Lesson 101. God's Will for me is perfect happiness.</title>
                    <para>Today we will continue with the theme of happiness. This is a key idea in
                        understanding what salvation means. You still believe it asks for suffering
                        as penance for your "sins." This is not so. Yet you must think it so while
                        you believe that sin is real, and that God's Son can sin.</para>
                    <para> If sin is real, then punishment is just and cannot be escaped. Salvation
                        thus cannot be purchased but through suffering. If sin is real, then
                        happiness must be illusion, for they cannot both be true. The sinful warrant
                        only death and pain, and it is this they ask for. For they know it waits for
                        them, and it will seek them out and find them somewhere, sometime, in some
                        form that evens the account they owe to God. They would escape Him in their
                        fear. And yet He will pursue, and they can not escape. </para>
                    <para> If sin is real, salvation must be pain. Pain is the cost of sin, and
                        suffering can never be escaped, if sin is real. Salvation must be feared,
                        for it will kill, but slowly, taking everything away before it grants the
                        welcome boon of death to victims who are little more than bones before
                        salvation is appeased. Its wrath is boundless, merciless, but wholly just. </para>
                    <para> Who would seek out such savage punishment? Who would not flee salvation,
                        and attempt in every way he can to drown the Voice which offers it to him?
                        Why would he try to listen and accept Its offering? If sin is real, its
                        offering is death, and meted out in cruel form to match the vicious wishes
                        in which sin is born. If sin is real, salvation has become your bitter
                        enemy, the curse of God upon you who have crucified His Son. </para>
                    <para> You need the practice periods today. The exercises teach sin is not real,
                        and all that you believe must come from sin will never happen, for it has no
                        cause. Accept Atonement with an open mind, which cherishes no lingering
                        belief that you have made a devil of God's Son. There is no sin. We practice
                        with this thought as often as we can today, because it is the basis for
                        today's idea. </para>
                    <para> God's Will for you is perfect happiness because there is no sin, and
                        suffering is causeless. Joy is just, and pain is but the sign you have
                        misunderstood yourself. Fear not the Will of God. But turn to it in
                        confidence that it will set you free from all the consequences sin has
                        wrought in feverish imagination. Say: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>God's Will for me is perfect                                happiness.There is no sin; it has                                no consequence. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>So should you start your practice periods, and then attempt again to find
                        the joy these thoughts will introduce into your mind. </para>
                    <para> Give these five minutes gladly, to remove the heavy load you lay upon
                        yourself with the insane belief that sin is real. Today escape from madness.
                        You are set on freedom's road, and now today's idea brings wings to speed
                        you on, and hope to go still faster to the waiting goal of peace. There is
                        no sin. Remember this today, and tell yourself as often as you can: </para>
                    <blockquote>

                    <para>You do not want to suffer. You may think it buys you something, and may
                        still believe a little that it buys you what you want. Yet this belief is
                        surely shaken now, at least enough to let you question it, and to suspect it
                        really makes no sense. It has not gone as yet, but lacks the roots that once
                        secured it tightly to the dark and hidden secret places of your mind.</para>
                    <para> Today we try to loose its weakened hold still further, and to realize
                        that pain is purposeless, without a cause and with no power to accomplish
                        anything. It cannot purchase anything at all. It offers nothing, and does
                        not exist. And everything you think it offers you is lacking in existence,
                        like itself. You have been slave to nothing. Be you free today to join the
                        happy Will of God. </para>
                    <para> For several days we will continue to devote our periods of practicing to
                        exercises planned to help you reach the happiness God's Will has placed in
                        you. Here is your home, and here your safety is. Here is your peace, and
                        here there is no fear. Here is salvation. Here is rest at last. </para>
                    <para> Begin your practice periods today with this acceptance of God's Will for
                        you: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>I share God's Will for happiness for me, and I                                accept it as my function now. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Then seek this function deep within your mind, for it is there, awaiting
                        but your choice. You cannot fail to find it when you learn it is your
                        choice, and that you share God's Will. </para>
                    <para> Be happy, for your only function here is happiness. You have no need to
                        be less loving to God's Son than He Whose Love created him as loving as
                        Himself. Besides these hourly five-minute rests, pause frequently today, to
                        tell yourself that you have now accepted happiness as your one function. And
                        be sure that you are joining with God's Will in doing this.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 103. God, being Love, is also happiness.</title>
                    <para>Happiness is an attribute of love. It cannot be apart from it. Nor can it
                        be experienced where love is not. Love has no limits, being everywhere. And
                        therefore joy is everywhere as well. Yet can the mind deny that this is so,
                        believing there are gaps in love where sin can enter, bringing pain instead
                        of joy. This strange belief would limit happiness by redefining love as
                        limited, and introducing opposition in what has no limit and no
                        opposite.</para>
                    <para> Fear is associated then with love, and its results become the heritage of
                        minds that think what they have made is real. These images, with no reality
                        in truth, bear witness to the fear of God, forgetting being Love, He must be
                        joy. This basic error we will try again to bring to truth today, and teach
                        ourselves: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>God, being Love, is also                                happiness.To fear Him is to be                                afraid of joy. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Begin your periods of practicing today with this association, which
                        corrects the false belief that God is fear. It also emphasizes happiness
                        belongs to you, because of what He is. </para>
                    <para> Allow this one correction to be placed within your mind each waking hour
                        today. Then welcome all the happiness it brings as truth replaces fear, and
                        joy becomes what you expect to take the place of pain. God, being Love, it
                        will be given you. Bolster this expectation frequently throughout the day,
                        and quiet all your fears with this assurance, kind and wholly true: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>God, being Love, is also happiness. And it is
                                happiness I seek today. I cannot fail, because I seek the
                                truth.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 104. I seek but what belongs to me in truth.</title>
                    <para>Today's idea continues with the thought that joy and peace are not but
                        idle dreams. They are your right, because of what you are. They come to you
                        from God, Who cannot fail to give you what He wills. Yet must there be a
                        place made ready to receive His gifts. They are not welcomed gladly by a
                        mind that has instead received the gifts it made where His belong, as
                        substitutes for them.</para>
                    <para> Today we would remove all meaningless and self-made gifts which we have
                        placed upon the holy altar where God's gifts belong. His are the gifts that
                        are our own in truth. His are the gifts that we inherited before time was,
                        and that will still be ours when time has passed into eternity. His are the
                        gifts that are within us now, for they are timeless. And we need not wait to
                        have them. They belong to us today. </para>
                    <para> Therefore, we choose to have them now, and know, in choosing them in
                        place of what we made, we but unite our will with what God wills, and
                        recognize the same as being one. Our longer practice periods today, the
                        hourly five minutes given truth for your salvation, should begin with this: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>I seek but what belongs to me in truth, And                                joy and peace are my inheritance. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Then lay aside the conflicts of the world that offer other gifts and other
                        goals made of illusions, witnessed to by them, and sought for only in a
                        world of dreams. </para>
                    <para> All this we lay aside, and seek instead that which is truly ours, as we
                        ask to recognize what God has given us. We clear a holy place within our
                        minds before His altar, where His gifts of peace and joy are welcome, and to
                        which we come to find what has been given us by Him. We come in confidence
                        today, aware that what belongs to us in truth is what He gives. And we would
                        wish for nothing else, for nothing else belongs to us in truth. </para>
                    <para> So do we clear the way for Him today by simply recognizing that His Will
                        is done already, and that joy and peace belong to us as His eternal gifts.
                        We will not let ourselves lose sight of them between the times we come to
                        seek for them where He has laid them. This reminder will we bring to mind as
                        often as we can: </para>
                    <blockquote>

                    <title>Lesson 105. God's peace and joy are mine.</title>
                    <para>God's peace and joy are yours. Today we will accept them, knowing they
                        belong to us. And we will try to understand these gifts increase as we
                        receive them. They are not like to the gifts the world can give, in which
                        the giver loses as he gives the gift; the taker is the richer by his loss.
                        Such are not gifts, but bargains made with guilt. The truly given gift
                        entails no loss. It is impossible that one can gain because another loses.
                        This implies a limit and an insufficiency.</para>
                    <para> No gift is given thus. Such "gifts" are but a bid for a more valuable
                        return; a loan with interest to be paid in full; a temporary lending, meant
                        to be a pledge of debt to be repaid with more than was received by him who
                        took the gift. This strange distortion of what giving means pervades all
                        levels of the world you see. It strips all meaning from the gifts you give,
                        and leaves you nothing in the ones you take. </para>
                    <para> A major learning goal this course has set is to reverse your view of
                        giving, so you can receive. For giving has become a source of fear, and so
                        you would avoid the only means by which you can receive. Accept God's peace
                        and joy, and you will learn a different way of looking at a gift. God's
                        gifts will never lessen when they are given away. They but increase thereby. </para>
                    <para> As Heaven's peace and joy intensify when you accept them as God's gift to
                        you, so does the joy of your Creator grow when you accept His joy and peace
                        as yours. True giving is creation. It extends the limitless to the
                        unlimited, eternity to timelessness, and love unto itself. It adds to all
                        that is complete already, not in simple terms of adding more, for that
                        implies that it was less before. It adds by letting what cannot contain
                        itself fulfill its aim of giving everything it has away, securing it forever
                        for itself. </para>
                    <para> Today accept God's peace and joy as yours. Let Him complete Himself as He
                        defines completion. You will understand that what completes Him must
                        complete His Son as well. He cannot give through loss. No more can you.
                        Receive His gift of joy and peace today, and He will thank you for your gift
                        to Him. </para>
                    <para> Today our practice periods will start a little differently. Begin today
                        by thinking of those brothers who have been denied by you the peace and joy
                        that are their right under the equal laws of God. Here you denied them to
                        yourself. And here you must return to claim them as your own. </para>
                    <para> Think of your "enemies" a little while, and tell each one, as he occurs
                        to you: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>My brother, peace and joy I offer                                you,That I may have God's peace                                and joy as mine. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para> Thus you prepare yourself to recognize God's gifts to you, and let your
                        mind be free of all that would prevent success today. Now are you ready to
                        accept the gift of peace and joy that God has given you. Now are you ready
                        to experience the joy and peace you have denied yourself. Now you can say,
                        "God's peace and joy are mine," for you have given what you would
                        receive.</para>
                    <para> You must succeed today, if you prepare your mind as we suggest. For you
                        have let all bars to peace and joy be lifted up, and what is yours can come
                        to you at last. So tell yourself, "God's peace and joy are mine," and close
                        your eyes a while, and let His Voice assure you that the words you speak are
                        true. </para>
                    <para> Spend your five minutes thus with Him each time you can today, but do not
                        think that less is worthless when you cannot give Him more. At least
                        remember hourly to say the words which call to Him to give you what He wills
                        to give, and wills you to receive. Determine not to interfere today with
                        what He wills. And if a brother seems to tempt you to deny God's gift to
                        him, see it as but another chance to let yourself receive the gifts of God
                        as yours. Then bless your brother thankfully, and say: </para>
                    <blockquote>

                        miracles are true. They will not fade when dreaming ends. They end the dream
                        instead; and last forever, for they come from God to His dear Son, whose
                        other name is you. Prepare yourself for miracles today. Today allow your
                        Father's ancient pledge to you and all your brothers to be kept. </para>
                    <para> Hear Him today, and listen to the Word which lifts the veil that lies
                        upon the earth, and wakes all those who sleep and cannot see. God calls to
                        them through you. He needs your voice to speak to them, for who could reach
                        God's Son except his Father, calling through your Self? Hear Him today, and
                        offer Him your voice to speak to all the multitude who wait to hear the Word
                        that He will speak today. </para>
                    <para> Be ready for salvation. It is here, and will today be given unto you. And
                        you will learn your function from the One Who chose it in your Father's Name
                        for you. Listen today, and you will hear a Voice which will resound
                        throughout the world through you. The bringer of all miracles has need that
                        you receive them first, and thus become the joyous giver of what you
                        received. </para>
                    <para> Thus does salvation start and thus it ends; when everything is yours and
                        everything is given away, it will remain with you forever. And the lesson
                        has been learned. Today we practice giving, not the way you understand it
                        now, but as it is. Each hour's exercises should begin with this request for
                        your enlightenment: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>I will be still and listen to the                                truth.What does it mean to give                                and to receive? </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para> Ask and expect an answer. Your request is one whose answer has been
                        waiting long to be received by you. It will begin the ministry for which you
                        came, and which will free the world from thinking giving is a way to lose.
                        And so the world becomes ready to understand and to receive. </para>
                    <para> Be still and listen to the truth today. For each five minutes spent in
                        listening, a thousand minds are opened to the truth and they will hear the
                        holy Word you hear. And when the hour is past, you will again release a
                        thousand more who pause to ask that truth be given them, along with you. </para>
                    <para> Today the holy Word of God is kept through your receiving it to give
                        away, so you can teach the world what giving means by listening and learning
                        it of Him. Do not forget today to reinforce your choice to hear and to
                        receive the Word by this reminder, given to yourself as often as is possible
                        today: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>Let me be still and listen to the                                truth.I am the messenger of God                                today,My voice is His, to give                                what I receive. </para>

                    <title>Lesson 107. Truth will correct all errors in my mind.</title>
                    <para>What can correct illusions but the truth? And what are errors but
                        illusions that remain unrecognized for what they are? Where truth has
                        entered errors disappear. They merely vanish, leaving not a trace by which
                        to be remembered. They are gone because, without belief, they have no life.
                        And so they disappear to nothingness, returning whence they came. From dust
                        to dust they come and go, for only truth remains.</para>
                    <para> Can you imagine what a state of mind without illusions is? How it would
                        feel? Try to remember when there was a time,–perhaps a minute, maybe even
                        less–when nothing came to interrupt your peace; when you were certain you
                        were loved and safe. Then try to picture what it would be like to have that
                        moment be extended to the end of time and to eternity. Then let the sense of
                        quiet that you felt be multiplied a hundred times, and then be multiplied
                        another hundred more. </para>
                    <para> And now you have a hint, not more than just the faintest intimation of
                        the state your mind will rest in when the truth has come. Without illusions
                        there could be no fear, no doubt and no attack. When truth has come all pain
                        is over, for there is no room for transitory thoughts and dead ideas to
                        linger in your mind. Truth occupies your mind completely, liberating you
                        from all beliefs in the ephemeral. They have no place because the truth has
                        come, and they are nowhere. They can not be found, for truth is everywhere
                        forever, now. </para>
                    <para> When truth has come it does not stay a while, to disappear or change to
                        something else. It does not shift and alter in its form, nor come and go and
                        go and come again. It stays exactly as it always was, to be depended on in
                        every need, and trusted with a perfect trust in all the seeming difficulties
                        and the doubts that the appearances the world presents engender. They will
                        merely blow away, when truth corrects the errors in your mind. </para>
                    <para> When truth has come it harbors in its wings the gift of perfect
                        constancy, and love which does not falter in the face of pain, but looks
                        beyond it, steadily and sure. Here is the gift of healing, for the truth
                        needs no defense, and therefore no attack is possible. Illusions can be
                        brought to truth to be corrected. But the truth stands far beyond illusions,
                        and can not be brought to them to turn them into truth. </para>
                    <para> Truth does not come and go nor shift nor change, in this appearance now
                        and then in that, evading capture and escaping grasp. It does not hide. It
                        stands in open light, in obvious accessibility. It is impossible that anyone
                        could seek it truly, and would not succeed. Today belongs to truth. Give
                        truth its due, and it will give you yours. You were not meant to suffer and
                        to die. Your Father wills these dreams be gone. Let truth correct them all. </para>
                    <para> We do not ask for what we do not have. We merely ask for what belongs to
                        us, that we may recognize it as our own. Today we practice on the happy note
                        of certainty that has been born of truth. The shaky and unsteady footsteps
                        of illusion are not our approach today. We are as certain of success as we
                        are sure we live and hope and breathe and think. We do not doubt we walk
                        with truth today, and count on it to enter into all the exercises that we do
                        this day. </para>
                    <para> Begin by asking Him Who goes with you upon this undertaking that He be in
                        your awareness as you go with Him. You are not made of flesh and blood and
                        bone, but were created by the selfsame Thought which gave the gift of life
                        to Him as well. He is your Brother, and so like to you your Father knows
                        that You are both the same. It is your Self you ask to go with you, and how
                        could He be absent where you are? </para>
                    <para> Truth will correct all errors in your mind which tell you you could be
                        apart from Him. You speak to Him today, and make your pledge to let His
                        function be fulfilled through you. To share His function is to share His
                        joy. His confidence is with you, as you say: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>Truth will correct all errors in my                                mind,And I will rest in Him Who                                is my Self. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Then let Him lead you gently to the truth, which will envelop you and give
                        you peace so deep and tranquil that you will return to the familiar world
                        reluctantly. </para>
                    <para> And yet you will be glad to look again upon this world. For you will
                        bring with you the promise of the changes which the truth that goes with you
                        will carry to the world. They will increase with every gift you give of five
                        small minutes, and the errors that surround the world will be corrected as
                        you let them be corrected in your mind. </para>
                    <para> Do not forget your function for today. Each time you tell yourself with
                        confidence, "Truth will correct all errors in my mind," you speak for all
                        the world and Him Who would release the world, as He would set you free.

                    <para>Vision depends upon today's idea. The light is in it, for it reconciles
                        all seeming opposites. And what is light except the resolution, born of
                        peace, of all your conflicts and mistaken thoughts into one concept which is
                        wholly true? Even that one will disappear, because the Thought behind it
                        will appear instead to take its place. And now you are at peace forever, for
                        the dream is over then.</para>
                    <para> True light that makes true vision possible is not the light the body's
                        eyes behold. It is a state of mind that has become so unified that darkness
                        cannot be perceived at all. And thus what is the same is seen as one, while
                        what is not the same remains unnoticed, for it is not there. </para>
                    <para> This is the light that shows no opposites, and vision, being healed, has
                        power to heal. This is the light that brings your peace of mind to other
                        minds, to share it and be glad that they are one with you and with
                        themselves. This is the light that heals because it brings single
                        perception, based upon one frame of reference, from which one meaning comes. </para>
                    <para> Here are both giving and receiving seen as different aspects of one
                        Thought whose truth does not depend on which is seen as first, nor which
                        appears to be in second place. Here it is understood that both occur
                        together, that the Thought remain complete. And in this understanding is the
                        base on which all opposites are reconciled, because they are perceived from
                        the same frame of reference which unifies this Thought. </para>
                    <para> One thought, completely unified, will serve to unify all thought. This is
                        the same as saying one correction will suffice for all correction, or that
                        to forgive one brother wholly is enough to bring salvation to all minds. For
                        these are but some special cases of one law which holds for every kind of
                        learning, if it be directed by the One Who knows the truth. </para>
                    <para> To learn that giving and receiving are the same has special usefulness,
                        because it can be tried so easily and seen as true. And when this special
                        case has proved it always works, in every circumstance where it is tried,
                        the thought behind it can be generalized to other areas of doubt and double
                        vision. And from there it will extend, and finally arrive at the one Thought
                        which underlies them all. </para>
                    <para> Today we practice with the special case of giving and receiving. We will
                        use this simple lesson in the obvious because it has results we cannot miss.
                        To give is to receive. Today we will attempt to offer peace to everyone, and
                        see how quickly peace returns to us. Light is tranquility, and in that peace
                        is vision given us, and we can see. </para>
                    <para> So we begin the practice periods with the instruction for today, and say: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>To give and to receive are one in truth. I                                will receive what I am giving now. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Then close your eyes, and for five minutes think of what you would hold
                        out to everyone, to have it yours. You might, for instance, say: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>To everyone I offer                                quietness.To everyone I offer                                peace of mind.To everyone I offer                                gentleness. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para> Say each one slowly and then pause a while, expecting to receive the gift
                        you gave. And it will come to you in the amount in which you gave it. You
                        will find you have exact return, for that is what you asked. It might be
                        helpful, too, to think of one to whom to give your gifts. He represents the
                        others, and through him you give to all. </para>
                    <para> Our very simple lesson for today will teach you much. Effect and cause
                        will be far better understood from this time on, and we will make much
                        faster progress now. Think of the exercises for today as quick advances in
                        your learning, made still faster and more sure each time you say, "To give
                        and to receive are one in truth." </para>
                </section>
                <section xml:id="L109">
                    <title>Lesson 109. I rest in God.</title>
                    <para>We ask for rest today, and quietness unshaken by the world's appearances.
                        We ask for peace and stillness, in the midst of all the turmoil born of
                        clashing dreams. We ask for safety and for happiness, although we seem to
                        look on danger and on sorrow. And we have the thought that will answer our
                        asking with what we request.</para>
                    <para> "I rest in God." This thought will bring to you the rest and quiet, peace
                        and stillness, and the safety and the happiness you seek. "I rest in God."
                        This thought has power to wake the sleeping truth in you, whose vision sees
                        beyond appearances to that same truth in everyone and everything there is.
                        Here is the end of suffering for all the world, and everyone who ever came
                        and yet will come to linger for a while. Here is the thought in which the
                        Son of God is born again, to recognize himself. </para>
                    <para> "I rest in God." Completely undismayed, this thought will carry you
                        through storms and strife, past misery and pain, past loss and death, and
                        onward to the certainty of God. There is no suffering it cannot heal. There
                        is no problem that it cannot solve. And no appearance but will turn to truth
                        before the eyes of you who rest in God. </para>
                    <para> This is the day of peace. You rest in God, and while the world is torn by
                        winds of hate your rest remains completely undisturbed. Yours is the rest of
                        truth. Appearances cannot intrude on you. You call to all to join you in
                        your rest, and they will hear and come to you because you rest in God. They
                        will not hear another voice than yours because you gave your voice to God,
                        and now you rest in Him and let Him speak through you. </para>
                    <para> In Him you have no cares and no concerns, no burdens, no anxiety, no
                        pain, no fear of future and no past regrets. In timelessness you rest, while
                        time goes by without its touch upon you, for your rest can never change in
                        any way at all. You rest today. And as you close your eyes, sink into
                        stillness. Let these periods of rest and respite reassure your mind that all
                        its frantic fantasies were but the dreams of fever that has passed away. Let
                        it be still and thankfully accept its healing. No more fearful dreams will
                        come, now that you rest in God. Take time today to slip away from dreams and
                        into peace. </para>
                    <para> Each hour that you take your rest today, a tired mind is suddenly made
                        glad, a bird with broken wings begins to sing, a stream long dry begins to
                        flow again. The world is born again each time you rest, and hourly remember
                        that you came to bring the peace of God into the world, that it might take
                        its rest along with you. </para>
                    <para> With each five minutes that you rest today, the world is nearer waking.
                        And the time when rest will be the only thing there is comes closer to all
                        worn and tired minds, too weary now to go their way alone. And they will
                        hear the bird begin to sing and see the stream begin to flow again, with
                        hope reborn and energy restored to walk with lightened steps along the road
                        that suddenly seems easy as they go. </para>
                    <para> You rest within the peace of God today, and call upon your brothers from
                        your rest to draw them to their rest, along with you. You will be faithful
                        to your trust today, forgetting no one, bringing everyone into the boundless
                        circle of your peace, the holy sanctuary where you rest. Open the temple
                        doors and let them come from far across the world, and near as well; your
                        distant brothers and your closest friends; bid them all enter here and rest
                        with you. </para>
                    <para> You rest within the peace of God today, quiet and unafraid. Each brother
                        comes to take his rest, and offer it to you. We rest together here, for thus
                        our rest is made complete, and what we give today we have received already.
                        Time is not the guardian of what we give today. We give to those unborn and
                        those passed by, to every Thought of God, and to the Mind in which these
                        Thoughts were born and where they rest. And we remind them of their resting
                        place each time we tell ourselves, "I rest in God." </para>

                    <title>Lesson 110. I am as God created me.</title>
                    <para>We will repeat today's idea from time to time. For this one thought would
                        be enough to save you and the world, if you believed that it is true. Its
                        truth would mean that you have made no changes in yourself that have
                        reality, nor changed the universe so that what God created was replaced by
                        fear and evil, misery and death. If you remain as God created you fear has
                        no meaning, evil is not real, and misery and death do not exist.</para>
                    <para> Today's idea is therefore all you need to let complete correction heal
                        your mind, and give you perfect vision that will heal all the mistakes that
                        any mind has made at any time or place. It is enough to heal the past and
                        make the future free. It is enough to let the present be accepted as it is.
                        It is enough to let time be the means for all the world to learn escape from
                        time, and every change that time appears to bring in passing by. </para>
                    <para> If you remain as God created you, appearances cannot replace the truth,
                        health cannot turn to sickness, nor can death be substitute for life, or
                        fear for love. All this has not occurred, if you remain as God created you.
                        You need no thought but just this one, to let redemption come to light the
                        world and free it from the past. </para>
                    <para> In this one thought is all the past undone; the present saved to quietly
                        extend into a timeless future. If you are as God created you, then there has
                        been no separation of your mind from His, no split between your mind and
                        other minds, and only unity within your own. </para>
                    <para> The healing power of today's idea is limitless. It is the birthplace of
                        all miracles, the great restorer of the truth to the awareness of the world.
                        Practice today's idea with gratitude. This is the truth that comes to set
                        you free. This is the truth that God has promised you. This is the Word in
                        which all sorrow ends. </para>
                    <para> For your five-minute practice periods, begin with this quotation from the
                        text: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>I am as God created me. His Son can suffer                                nothing.And I am His Son.                            </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para> Then, with this statement firmly in your mind, try to discover in your
                        mind the Self Who is the holy Son of God Himself. </para>
                    <para> Seek Him within you Who is Christ in you, the Son of God and brother to
                        the world; the Savior Who has been forever saved, with power to save whoever
                        touches Him, however lightly, asking for the Word that tells him he is
                        brother unto Him. </para>
                    <para> You are as God created you. Today honor your Self. Let graven images you
                        made to be the Son of God instead of what he is be worshipped not today.
                        Deep in your mind the holy Christ in you is waiting your acknowledgment as
                        you. And you are lost and do not know yourself while He is unacknowledged
                        and unknown. </para>
                    <para> Seek Him today, and find Him. He will be your Savior from all idols you
                        have made. For when you find Him, you will understand how worthless are your
                        idols, and how false the images which you believed were you. Today we make a
                        great advance to truth by letting idols go, and opening our hands and hearts
                        and minds to God today. </para>
                    <para> We will remember Him throughout the day with thankful hearts and loving
                        thoughts for all who meet with us today. For it is thus that we remember
                        Him. And we will say, that we may be reminded of His Son, our holy Self, the
                        Christ in each of us: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>I am as God created me. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Let us declare this truth as often as we can. This is the Word of God that
                        sets you free. This is the key that opens up the gate of Heaven, and that
                        lets you enter in the peace of God and His eternity. </para>

                    <title>Review III Introduction (Lessons 91 - 110)</title>
                    <para>Our next review begins today. We will review two recent lessons every day
                        for ten successive days of practicing. We will observe a special format for
                        these practice periods, that you are urged to follow just as closely as you
                        can.</para>
                    <para>We understand, of course, that it may be impossible for you to undertake
                        what is suggested here as optimal each day and every hour of the day.
                        Learning will not be hampered when you miss a practice period because it is
                        impossible at the appointed time. Nor is it necessary that you make
                        excessive efforts to be sure that you catch up in terms of numbers. Rituals
                        are not our aim, and would defeat our goal.</para>
                    <para>But learning will be hampered when you skip a practice period because you
                        are unwilling to devote the time to it that you are asked to give. Do not
                        deceive yourself in this. Unwillingness can be most carefully concealed
                        behind a cloak of situations you cannot control. Learn to distinguish
                        situations that are poorly suited to your practicing from those that you
                        establish to uphold a camouflage for your unwillingness.</para>
                    <para>Those practice periods that you have lost because you did not want to do
                        them, for whatever reason, should be done as soon as you have changed your
                        mind about your goal. You are unwilling to cooperate in practicing salvation
                        only if it interferes with goals you hold more dear. When you withdraw the
                        value given them, allow your practice periods to be replacements for your
                        litanies to them. They gave you nothing. But your practicing can offer
                        everything to you. And so accept their offering and be at peace.</para>
                    <para>The format you should use for these reviews is this: Devote five minutes
                        twice a day, or longer if you would prefer it, to considering the thoughts
                        that are assigned. Read over the ideas and comments that are written down
                        for each day's exercise. And then begin to think about them, while letting
                        your mind relate them to your needs, your seeming problems and all your
                        concerns.</para>
                    <para>Place the ideas within your mind, and let it use them as it chooses. Give
                        it faith that it will use them wisely, being helped in its decisions by the
                        One Who gave the thoughts to you. What can you trust but what is in your
                        mind? Have faith, in these reviews, the means the Holy Spirit uses will not
                        fail. The wisdom of your mind will come to your assistance. Give direction
                        at the outset; then lean back in quiet faith, and let the mind employ the
                        thoughts you gave as they were given you for it to use.</para>
                    <para>You have been given them in perfect trust; in perfect confidence that you
                        would use them well; in perfect faith that you would see their messages and
                        use them for yourself. Offer them to your mind in that same trust and
                        confidence and faith. It will not fail. It is the Holy Spirit's chosen means
                        for your salvation. Since it has His trust, His means must surely merit
                        yours as well.</para>
                    <para>We emphasize the benefits to you if you devote the first five minutes of
                        the day to your reviews, and also give the last five minutes of your waking
                        day to them. If this cannot be done, at least try to divide them so you
                        undertake one in the morning, and the other in the hour just before you go
                        to sleep.</para>
                    <para>The exercises to be done throughout the day are equally important, and
                        perhaps of even greater value. You have been inclined to practice only at
                        appointed times, and then go on your way to other things, without applying
                        what you learned to them. As a result, you have gained little reinforcement,
                        and have not given your learning a fair chance to prove how great are its
                        potential gifts to you. Here is another chance to use it well.</para>
                    <para>In these reviews, we stress the need to let your learning not lie idly by
                        between your longer practice periods. Attempt to give your daily two ideas a
                        brief but serious review each hour. Use one on the hour, and the other one a
                        half an hour later. You need not give more than just a moment to each one.
                        Repeat it, and allow your mind to rest a little time in silence and in
                        peace. Then turn to other things, but try to keep the thought with you, and
                        let it serve to help you keep your peace throughout the day as well.</para>
                    <para>If you are shaken, think of it again. These practice periods are planned
                        to help you form the habit of applying what you learn each day to everything
                        you do. Do not repeat the thought and lay it down. Its usefulness is
                        limitless to you. And it is meant to serve you in all ways, all times and
                        places, and whenever you need help of any kind. Try, then, to take it with
                        you in the business of the day and make it holy, worthy of God's Son,
                        acceptable to God and to your Self.</para>
                    <para>Each day's review assignments will conclude with a restatement of the
                        thought to use each hour, and the one to be applied on each half hour as
                        well. Forget them not. This second chance with each of these ideas will
                        bring such large advances that we come from these reviews with learning
                        gains so great we will continue on more solid ground, with firmer footsteps
                        and with stronger faith.<blockquote>

                    <title>Lesson 121. Forgiveness is the key to happiness.</title>
                    <para>Here is the answer to your search for peace. Here is the key to meaning in
                        a world that seems to make no sense. Here is the way to safety in apparent
                        dangers that appear to threaten you at every turn, and bring uncertainty to
                        all your hopes of ever finding quietness and peace. Here are all questions
                        answered; here the end of all uncertainty ensured at last.</para>
                    <para>The unforgiving mind is full of fear, and offers love no room to be
                        itself; no place where it can spread its wings in peace and soar above the
                        turmoil of the world. The unforgiving mind is sad, without the hope of
                        respite and release from pain. It suffers and abides in misery, peering
                        about in darkness, seeing not, yet certain of the danger lurking
                        there.</para>
                    <para>The unforgiving mind is torn with doubt, confused about itself and all it
                        sees; afraid and angry, weak and blustering, afraid to go ahead, afraid to
                        stay, afraid to waken or to go to sleep, afraid of every sound, yet more
                        afraid of stillness; terrified of darkness, yet more terrified at the
                        approach of light. What can the unforgiving mind perceive but its damnation?
                        What can it behold except the proof that all its sins are real?</para>
                    <para>The unforgiving mind sees no mistakes, but only sins. It looks upon the
                        world with sightless eyes, and shrieks as it beholds its own projections
                        rising to attack its miserable parody of life. It wants to live, yet wishes
                        it were dead. It wants forgiveness, yet it sees no hope. It wants escape,
                        yet can conceive of none because it sees the sinful everywhere.</para>
                    <para>The unforgiving mind is in despair, without the prospect of a future which
                        can offer anything but more despair. Yet it regards its judgment of the
                        world as irreversible, and does not see it has condemned itself to this
                        despair. It thinks it cannot change, for what it sees bears witness that its
                        judgment is correct. It does not ask, because it thinks it knows. It does
                        not question, certain it is right.</para>
                    <para>Forgiveness is acquired. It is not inherent in the mind, which cannot sin.
                        As sin is an idea you taught yourself, forgiveness must be learned by you as
                        well, but from a Teacher other than yourself, Who represents the other Self
                        in you. Through Him you learn how to forgive the self you think you made,
                        and let it disappear. Thus you return your mind as one to Him Who is your
                        Self, and Who can never sin.</para>
                    <para>Each unforgiving mind presents you with an opportunity to teach your own
                        how to forgive itself. Each one awaits release from hell through you, and
                        turns to you imploringly for Heaven here and now. It has no hope, but you
                        become its hope. And as its hope, do you become your own. The unforgiving
                        mind must learn through your forgiveness that it has been saved from hell.
                        And as you teach salvation, you will learn. Yet all your teaching and your
                        learning will be not of you, but of the Teacher Who was given you to show
                        the way to you.</para>
                    <para>Today we practice learning to forgive. If you are willing, you can learn
                        today to take the key to happiness, and use it on your own behalf. We will
                        devote ten minutes in the morning, and at night another ten, to learning how
                        to give forgiveness and receive forgiveness, too.</para>
                    <para>The unforgiving mind does not believe that giving and receiving are the
                        same. Yet we will try to learn today that they are one through practicing
                        forgiveness toward one whom you think of as an enemy, and one whom you
                        consider as a friend. And as you learn to see them both as one, we will
                        extend the lesson to yourself, and see that their escape included
                        yours.</para>
                    <para>Begin the longer practice periods by thinking of someone you do not like,
                        who seems to irritate you, or to cause regret in you if you should meet him;
                        one you actively despise, or merely try to overlook. It does not matter what
                        the form your anger takes. You probably have chosen him already. He will
                        do.</para>
                    <para>Now close your eyes and see him in your mind, and look at him a while. Try
                        to perceive some light in him somewhere; a little gleam which you had never
                        noticed. Try to find some little spark of brightness shining through the
                        ugly picture that you hold of him. Look at this picture till you see a light
                        somewhere within it, and then try to let this light extend until it covers
                        him, and makes the picture beautiful and good.</para>
                    <para>Look at this changed perception for a while, and turn your mind to one you
                        call a friend. Try to transfer the light you learned to see around your
                        former "enemy" to him. Perceive him now as more than friend to you, for in
                        that light his holiness shows you your savior, saved and saving, healed and
                        whole.</para>
                    <para>Then let him offer you the light you see in him, and let your "enemy" and
                        friend unite in blessing you with what you gave. Now are you one with them,
                        and they with you. Now have you been forgiven by yourself. Do not forget,
                        throughout the day, the role forgiveness plays in bringing happiness to
                        every unforgiving mind, with yours among them. Every hour tell yourself:<blockquote>

                    <para>What could you want forgiveness cannot give? Do you want peace?
                        Forgiveness offers it. Do you want happiness, a quiet mind, a certainty of
                        purpose, and a sense of worth and beauty that transcends the world? Do you
                        want care and safety, and the warmth of sure protection always? Do you want
                        a quietness that cannot be disturbed, a gentleness that never can be hurt, a
                        deep, abiding comfort, and a rest so perfect it can never be upset?</para>
                    <para>All this forgiveness offers you, and more. It sparkles on your eyes as you
                        awake, and gives you joy with which to meet the day. It soothes your
                        forehead while you sleep, and rests upon your eyelids so you see no dreams
                        of fear and evil, malice and attack. And when you wake again, it offers you
                        another day of happiness and peace. All this forgiveness offers you, and
                        more.</para>
                    <para>Forgiveness lets the veil be lifted up that hides the face of Christ from
                        those who look with unforgiving eyes upon the world. It lets you recognize
                        the Son of God, and clears your memory of all dead thoughts so that
                        remembrance of your Father can arise across the threshold of your mind. What
                        would you want forgiveness cannot give? What gifts but these are worthy to
                        be sought? What fancied value, trivial effect or transient promise, never to
                        be kept, can hold more hope than what forgiveness brings?</para>
                    <para>Why would you seek an answer other than the answer that will answer
                        everything? Here is the perfect answer, given to imperfect questions,
                        meaningless requests, halfhearted willingness to hear, and less than halfway
                        diligence and partial trust. Here is the answer! Seek for it no more. You
                        will not find another one instead.</para>
                    <para>God's plan for your salvation cannot change, nor can it fail. Be thankful
                        it remains exactly as He planned it. Changelessly it stands before you like
                        an open door, with warmth and welcome calling from beyond the doorway,
                        bidding you to enter in and make yourself at home, where you belong.</para>
                    <para>Here is the answer! Would you stand outside while all of Heaven waits for
                        you within? Forgive and be forgiven. As you give you will receive. There is
                        no plan but this for the salvation of the Son of God. Let us today rejoice
                        that this is so, for here we have an answer, clear and plain, beyond deceit
                        in its simplicity. All the complexities the world has spun of fragile
                        cobwebs disappear before the power and the majesty of this extremely simple
                        statement of the truth.</para>
                    <para>Here is the answer! Do not turn away in aimless wandering again. Accept
                        salvation now. It is the gift of God, and not the world. The world can give
                        no gifts of any value to a mind that has received what God has given as its
                        own. God wills salvation be received today, and that the intricacies of your
                        dreams no longer hide their nothingness from you.</para>
                    <para>Open your eyes today and look upon a happy world of safety and of peace.
                        Forgiveness is the means by which it comes to take the place of hell. In
                        quietness it rises up to greet your open eyes, and fill your heart with deep
                        tranquility as ancient truths, forever newly born, arise in your awareness.
                        What you will remember then can never be described. Yet your forgiveness
                        offers it to you.</para>
                    <para>Remembering the gifts forgiveness gives, we undertake our practicing today
                        with hope and faith that this will be the day salvation will be ours.
                        Earnestly and gladly will we seek for it today, aware we hold the key within
                        our hands, accepting Heaven's answer to the hell we made, but where we would
                        remain no more.</para>
                    <para>Morning and evening do we gladly give a quarter of an hour to the search
                        in which the end of hell is guaranteed. Begin in hopefulness, for we have
                        reached the turning point at which the road becomes far easier. And now the
                        way is short that yet we travel. We are close indeed to the appointed ending
                        of the dream.</para>
                    <para>Sink into happiness as you begin these practice periods, for they hold out
                        the sure rewards of questions answered and what your acceptance of the
                        answer brings. Today it will be given you to feel the peace forgiveness
                        offers, and the joy the lifting of the veil holds out to you.</para>
                    <para>Before the light you will receive today the world will fade until it
                        disappears, and you will see another world arise you have no words to
                        picture. Now we walk directly into light, and we receive the gifts that have
                        been held in store for us since time began, kept waiting for today.</para>
                    <para>Forgiveness offers everything you want. Today all things you want are
                        given you. Let not your gifts recede throughout the day, as you return again
                        to meet a world of shifting change and bleak appearances. Retain your gifts
                        in clear awareness as you see the changeless in the heart of change; the
                        light of truth behind appearances.</para>
                    <para>Be tempted not to let your gifts slip by and drift into forgetfulness, but
                        hold them firmly in your mind by your attempts to think of them at least a
                        minute as each quarter of an hour passes by. Remind yourself how precious
                        are these gifts with this reminder, which has power to hold your gifts in
                        your awareness through the day:<blockquote>

                    <para>Today let us be thankful. We have come to gentler pathways and to smoother
                        roads. There is no thought of turning back, and no implacable resistance to
                        the truth. A bit of wavering remains, some small objections and a little
                        hesitance, but you can well be grateful for your gains, which are far
                        greater than you realize.</para>
                    <para>A day devoted now to gratitude will add the benefit of some insight into
                        the real extent of all the gains which you have made; the gifts you have
                        received. Be glad today, in loving thankfulness, your Father has not left
                        you to yourself, nor let you wander in the dark alone. Be grateful He has
                        saved you from the self you thought you made to take the place of Him and
                        His creation. Give Him thanks today.</para>
                    <para>Give thanks that He has not abandoned you, and that His Love forever will
                        remain shining on you, forever without change. Give thanks as well that you
                        are changeless, for the Son He loves is changeless as Himself. Be grateful
                        you are saved. Be glad you have a function in salvation to fulfill. Be
                        thankful that your value far transcends your meager gifts and petty
                        judgments of the one whom God established as His Son.</para>
                    <para>Today in gratitude we lift our hearts above despair, and raise our
                        thankful eyes, no longer looking downward to the dust. We sing the song of
                        thankfulness today, in honor of the Self that God has willed to be our true
                        Identity in Him. Today we smile on everyone we see, and walk with lightened

                        to Him. His Word is soundless if it be not heard. In thanking Him the thanks
                        are yours as well. An unheard message will not save the world, however
                        mighty be the Voice that speaks, however loving may the message be.</para>
                    <para>Thanks be to you who heard, for you become the messenger who brings His
                        Voice with you, and lets It echo round and round the world. Receive the
                        thanks of God today, as you give thanks to Him. For He would offer you the
                        thanks you give, since He receives your gifts in loving gratitude, and gives
                        them back a thousand and a hundred thousand more than they were given. He
                        will bless your gifts by sharing them with you. And so they grow in power
                        and in strength, until they fill the world with gladness and with
                        gratitude.</para>

                        thanking Him. This holy half an hour given Him will be returned to you in
                        terms of years for every second; power to save the world eons more quickly
                        for your thanks to Him.</para>
                    <para>Receive His thanks, and you will understand how lovingly He holds you in

                        gratitude to you. Remember hourly to think of Him, and give Him thanks for
                        everything He gave His Son, that he might rise above the world, remembering
                        his Father and his Self.</para>

                        way to truth, for God is our Companion as we walk the world a little while.
                        And those who come to follow us will recognize the way because the light we

                        awareness of His Presence. We are one with Him today in recognition and

                        are restored to the tranquility and peace of mind in which they were
                        created. And we see it in the dying and the dead as well, restoring them to

                    <para>No miracle can ever be denied to those who know that they are one with

                        ones who walk beside them now. Their thoughts are timeless, and apart from
                        distance as apart from time.</para>
                    <para>We join in this awareness as we say that we are one with God. For in these

                        accordingly. We have accepted, and we now would give. For we would keep the
                        gifts our Father gave. Today we would experience ourselves at one with Him,
                        so that the world may share our recognition of reality. In our experience
                        the world is freed. As we deny our separation from our Father, it is healed
                        along with us.</para>
                    <para>Peace be to you today. Secure your peace by practicing awareness you are
                        one with your Creator, as He is with you. Sometime today, whenever it seems
                        best, devote a half an hour to the thought that you are one with God. This
                        is our first attempt at an extended period for which we give no rules nor
                        special words to guide your meditation. We will trust God's Voice to speak
                        as He sees fit today, certain He will not fail. Abide with Him this half an
                        hour. He will do the rest.</para>
                    <para>Your benefit will not be less if you believe that nothing happens. You may
                        not be ready to accept the gain today. Yet sometime, somewhere, it will come
                        to you, nor will you fail to recognize it when it dawns with certainty upon
                        your mind. This half an hour will be framed in gold, with every minute like
                        a diamond set around the mirror that this exercise will offer you. And you
                        will see Christ's face upon it, in reflection of your own.</para>
                    <para>Perhaps today, perhaps tomorrow, you will see your own transfiguration in
                        the glass this holy half an hour will hold out to you, to look upon
                        yourself. When you are ready you will find it there, within your mind and
                        waiting to be found. You will remember then the thought to which you gave
                        this half an hour, thankfully aware no time was ever better spent.</para>
                    <para>Perhaps today, perhaps tomorrow, you will look into this glass, and
                        understand the sinless light you see belongs to you; the loveliness you look
                        on is your own. Count this half hour as your gift to God, in certainty that
                        His return will be a sense of love you cannot understand, a joy too deep for
                        you to comprehend, a sight too holy for the body's eyes to see. And yet you
                        can be sure someday, perhaps today, perhaps tomorrow, you will understand
                        and comprehend and see.</para>
                    <para>Add further jewels to the golden frame that holds the mirror offered you
                        today, by hourly repeating to yourself:<blockquote>
                            <para>Let me remember I am one with                                    God,</para>

                    <para>Let this day be a day of stillness and of quiet listening. Your Father
                        wills you hear His Word today. He calls to you from deep within your mind
                        where He abides. Hear Him today. No peace is possible until His Word is
                        heard around the world; until your mind, in quiet listening, accepts the
                        message that the world must hear to usher in the quiet time of peace.</para>
                    <para>This world will change through you. No other means can save it, for God's
                        plan is simply this: The Son of God is free to save himself, given the Word
                        of God to be his Guide, forever in his mind and at his side to lead him
                        surely to his Father's house by his own will, forever free as God's. He is
                        not led by force, but only love. He is not judged, but only
                        sanctified.</para>
                    <para>In stillness we will hear God's Voice today without intrusion of our petty
                        thoughts, without our personal desires, and without all judgment of His holy
                        Word. We will not judge ourselves today, for what we are can not be judged.
                        We stand apart from all the judgments which the world has laid upon the Son
                        of God. It knows him not. Today we will not listen to the world, but wait in
                        silence for the Word of God.</para>
                    <para>Hear, holy Son of God, your Father speak. His Voice would give to you His
                        holy Word, to spread across the world the tidings of salvation and the holy
                        time of peace. We gather at the throne of God today, the quiet place within
                        the mind where He abides forever, in the holiness that He created and will
                        never leave.</para>
                    <para>He has not waited until you return your mind to Him to give His Word to
                        you. He has not hid Himself from you, while you have wandered off a little
                        while from Him. He does not cherish the illusions which you hold about
                        yourself. He knows His Son, and wills that he remain as part of Him
                        regardless of his dreams; regardless of his madness that his will is not his
                        own.</para>
                    <para>Today He speaks to you. His Voice awaits your silence, for His Word can
                        not be heard until your mind is quiet for a while, and meaningless desires
                        have been stilled. Await His Word in quiet. There is peace within you to be
                        called upon today, to help make ready your most holy mind to hear the Voice
                        for its Creator speak.</para>
                    <para>Three times today, at times most suitable for silence, give ten minutes
                        set apart from listening to the world, and choose instead a gentle listening
                        to the Word of God. He speaks from nearer than your heart to you. His Voice
                        is closer than your hand. His Love is everything you are and that He is; the
                        same as you, and you the same as He.</para>
                    <para>It is your voice to which you listen as He speaks to you. It is your word
                        He speaks. It is the Word of freedom and of peace, of unity of will and
                        purpose, with no separation nor division in the single Mind of Father and of
                        Son. In quiet listen to your Self today, and let Him tell you God has never
                        left His Son, and you have never left your Self.</para>
                    <para>Only be quiet. You will need no rule but this, to let your practicing
                        today lift you above the thinking of the world, and free your vision from
                        the body's eyes. Only be still and listen. You will hear the Word in which
                        the Will of God the Son joins in his Father's Will, at one with it, with no
                        illusions interposed between the wholly indivisible and true. As every hour
                        passes by today, be still a moment and remind yourself you have a special
                        purpose for this day; in quiet to receive the Word of God.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 126. All that I give is given to myself.</title>
                    <para>Today's idea, completely alien to the ego and the thinking of the world,
                        is crucial to the thought reversal that this course will bring about. If you
                        believed this statement, there would be no problem in complete forgiveness,
                        certainty of goal, and sure direction. You would understand the means by
                        which salvation comes to you, and would not hesitate to use it now.</para>
                    <para>Let us consider what you do believe, in place of this idea. It seems to
                        you that other people are apart from you, and able to behave in ways which
                        have no bearing on your thoughts, nor yours on theirs. Therefore, your
                        attitudes have no effect on them, and their appeals for help are not in any
                        way related to your own. You further think that they can sin without
                        affecting your perception of yourself, while you can judge their sin, and
                        yet remain apart from condemnation and at peace.</para>
                    <para>When you "forgive" a sin, there is no gain to you directly. You give
                        charity to one unworthy, merely to point out that you are better, on a
                        higher plane than he whom you forgive. He has not earned your charitable
                        tolerance, which you bestow on one unworthy of the gift, because his sins
                        have lowered him beneath a true equality with you. He has no claim on your
                        forgiveness. It holds out a gift to him, but hardly to yourself.</para>
                    <para>Thus is forgiveness basically unsound; a charitable whim, benevolent yet
                        undeserved, a gift bestowed at times, at other times withheld. Unmerited,
                        withholding it is just, nor is it fair that you should suffer when it is
                        withheld. The sin that you forgive is not your own. Someone apart from you
                        committed it. And if you then are gracious unto him by giving him what he
                        does not deserve, the gift is no more yours than was his sin.</para>
                    <para>If this be true, forgiveness has no grounds on which to rest dependably
                        and sure. It is an eccentricity, in which you sometimes choose to give
                        indulgently an undeserved reprieve. Yet it remains your right to let the
                        sinner not escape the justified repayment for his sin. Think you the Lord of
                        Heaven would allow the world's salvation to depend on this? Would not His
                        care for you be small indeed, if your salvation rested on a whim?</para>
                    <para>You do not understand forgiveness. As you see it, it is but a check upon
                        overt attack, without requiring correction in your mind. It cannot give you
                        peace as you perceive it. It is not a means for your release from what you
                        see in someone other than yourself. It has no power to restore your unity
                        with him to your awareness. It is not what God intended it to be for
                        you.</para>
                    <para>Not having given Him the gift He asks of you, you cannot recognize His
                        gifts, and think He has not given them to you. Yet would He ask you for a
                        gift unless it was for you? Could He be satisfied with empty gestures, and
                        evaluate such petty gifts as worthy of His Son? Salvation is a better gift
                        than this. And true forgiveness, as the means by which it is attained, must
                        heal the mind that gives, for giving is receiving. What remains as
                        unreceived has not been given, but what has been given must have been
                        received.</para>
                    <para>Today we try to understand the truth that giver and receiver are the same.
                        You will need help to make this meaningful, because it is so alien to the
                        thoughts to which you are accustomed. But the Help you need is there. Give
                        Him your faith today, and ask Him that He share your practicing in truth
                        today. And if you only catch a tiny glimpse of the release that lies in the
                        idea we practice for today, this is a day of glory for the world.</para>
                    <para>Give fifteen minutes twice today to the attempt to understand today's
                        idea. It is the thought by which forgiveness takes its proper place in your
                        priorities. It is the thought that will release your mind from every bar to
                        what forgiveness means, and let you realize its worth to you.</para>
                    <para>In silence, close your eyes upon the world that does not understand
                        forgiveness, and seek sanctuary in the quiet place where thoughts are
                        changed and false beliefs laid by. Repeat today's idea, and ask for help in
                        understanding what it really means. Be willing to be taught. Be glad to hear
                        the Voice of truth and healing speak to you, and you will understand the
                        words He speaks, and recognize He speaks your words to you.</para>
                    <para>As often as you can, remind yourself you have a goal today; an aim which
                        makes this day of special value to yourself and all your brothers. Do not
                        let your mind forget this goal for long, but tell yourself:<blockquote>
                            <para>All that I give is given to                                    myself.</para>
                            <para>The Help I need to learn that this is true                                    is with me now.</para>
                            <para>And I will trust in Him.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>Then spend a quiet moment, opening your mind to His correction and His
                        Love. And what you hear of Him you will believe, for what He gives will be
                        received by you.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 127. There is no love but God's.</title>
                    <para>Perhaps you think that different kinds of love are possible. Perhaps you
                        think there is a kind of love for this, a kind for that; a way of loving
                        one, another way of loving still another. Love is one. It has no separate
                        parts and no degrees; no kinds nor levels, no divergencies and no
                        distinctions. It is like itself, unchanged throughout. It never alters with
                        a person or a circumstance. It is the Heart of God, and also of His
                        Son.</para>
                    <para>Love's meaning is obscure to anyone who thinks that love can change. He
                        does not see that changing love must be impossible. And thus he thinks that
                        he can love at times, and hate at other times. He also thinks that love can
                        be bestowed on one, and yet remain itself although it is withheld from
                        others. To believe these things of love is not to understand it. If it could
                        make such distinctions, it would have to judge between the righteous and the
                        sinner, and perceive the Son of God in separate parts.</para>
                    <para>Love cannot judge. As it is one itself, it looks on all as one. Its
                        meaning lies in oneness. And it must elude the mind that thinks of it as
                        partial or in part. There is no love but God's, and all of love is His.
                        There is no other principle that rules where love is not. Love is a law
                        without an opposite. Its wholeness is the power holding everything as one,
                        the link between the Father and the Son which holds Them Both forever as the
                        same.</para>
                    <para>No course whose purpose is to teach you to remember what you really are
                        could fail to emphasize that there can never be a difference in what you
                        really are and what love is. Love's meaning is your own, and shared by God
                        Himself. For what you are is what He is. There is no love but His, and what
                        He is, is everything there is. There is no limit placed upon Himself, and so
                        are you unlimited as well.</para>
                    <para>No law the world obeys can help you grasp love's meaning. What the world
                        believes was made to hide love's meaning, and to keep it dark and secret.
                        There is not one principle the world upholds but violates the truth of what
                        love is, and what you are as well.</para>
                    <para>Seek not within the world to find your Self. Love is not found in darkness
                        and in death. Yet it is perfectly apparent to the eyes that see and ears
                        that hear love's Voice. Today we practice making free your mind of all the
                        laws you think you must obey; of all the limits under which you live, and
                        all the changes that you think are part of human destiny. Today we take the
                        largest single step this course requests in your advance towards its
                        established goal.</para>
                    <para>If you achieve the faintest glimmering of what love means today, you have
                        advanced in distance without measure and in time beyond the count of years
                        to your release. Let us together, then, be glad to give some time to God
                        today, and understand there is no better use for time than this.</para>
                    <para>For fifteen minutes twice today escape from every law in which you now
                        believe. Open your mind and rest. The world that seems to hold you prisoner
                        can be escaped by anyone who does not hold it dear. Withdraw all value you
                        have placed upon its meager offerings and senseless gifts, and let the gift
                        of God replace them all.</para>
                    <para>Call to your Father, certain that His Voice will answer. He Himself has
                        promised this. And He Himself will place a spark of truth within your mind
                        wherever you give up a false belief, a dark illusion of your own reality and
                        what love means. He will shine through your idle thoughts today, and help
                        you understand the truth of love. In loving gentleness He will abide with
                        you, as you allow His Voice to teach love's meaning to your clean and open
                        mind. And He will bless the lesson with His Love.</para>
                    <para>Today the legion of the future years of waiting for salvation disappears
                        before the timelessness of what you learn. Let us give thanks today that we
                        are spared a future like the past. Today we leave the past behind us,
                        nevermore to be remembered. And we raise our eyes upon a different present,
                        where a future dawns unlike the past in every attribute.</para>
                    <para>The world in infancy is newly born. And we will watch it grow in health
                        and strength, to shed its blessing upon all who come to learn to cast aside
                        the world they thought was made in hate to be love's enemy. Now are they all
                        made free, along with us. Now are they all our brothers in God's
                        Love.</para>
                    <para>We will remember them throughout the day, because we cannot leave a part
                        of us outside our love if we would know our Self. At least three times an
                        hour think of one who makes the journey with you, and who came to learn what
                        you must learn. And as he comes to mind, give him this message from your Self:<blockquote>
                            <para>I bless you, brother, with the Love of                                    God, which I would share with you.</para>
                            <para>For I would learn the joyous lesson that                                    there is no love but God's</para>
                            <para>and yours and mine and                                    everyone's.</para>

                    <para>The world you see holds nothing that you need to offer you; nothing that
                        you can use in any way, nor anything at all that serves to give you joy.
                        Believe this thought, and you are saved from years of misery, from countless
                        disappointments, and from hopes that turn to bitter ashes of despair. No one
                        but must accept this thought as true, if he would leave the world behind and
                        soar beyond its petty scope and little ways.</para>
                    <para>Each thing you value here is but a chain that binds you to the world, and
                        it will serve no other end but this. For everything must serve the purpose
                        you have given it, until you see a different purpose there. The only purpose
                        worthy of your mind this world contains is that you pass it by, without
                        delaying to perceive some hope where there is none. Be you deceived no more.
                        The world you see holds nothing that you want.</para>
                    <para>Escape today the chains you place upon your mind when you perceive
                        salvation here. For what you value you make part of you as you perceive
                        yourself. All things you seek to make your value greater in your sight limit
                        you further, hide your worth from you, and add another bar across the door
                        that leads to true awareness of your Self.</para>
                    <para>Let nothing that relates to body thoughts delay your progress to
                        salvation, nor permit temptation to believe the world holds anything you
                        want to hold you back. Nothing is here to cherish. Nothing here is worth one
                        instant of delay and pain; one moment of uncertainty and doubt. The
                        worthless offer nothing. Certainty of worth can not be found in
                        worthlessness.</para>
                    <para>Today we practice letting go all thought of values we have given to the
                        world. We leave it free of purposes we gave its aspects and its phases and
                        its dreams. We hold it purposeless within our minds, and loosen it from all
                        we wish it were. Thus do we lift the chains that bar the door to freedom
                        from the world, and go beyond all little values and diminished goals.</para>
                    <para>Pause and be still a little while, and see how far you rise above the
                        world, when you release your mind from chains and let it seek the level
                        where it finds itself at home. It will be grateful to be free a while. It
                        knows where it belongs. But free its wings, and it will fly in sureness and
                        in joy to join its holy purpose. Let it rest in its Creator, there to be
                        restored to sanity, to freedom and to love.</para>
                    <para>Give it ten minutes rest three times today. And when your eyes are opened
                        afterwards, you will not value anything you see as much as when you looked
                        at it before. Your whole perspective on the world will shift by just a
                        little, every time you let your mind escape its chains. The world is not
                        where it belongs. And you belong where it would be, and where it goes to
                        rest when you release it from the world. Your Guide is sure. Open your mind
                        to Him. Be still and rest.</para>
                    <para>Protect your mind throughout the day as well. And when you think you see
                        some value in an aspect or an image of the world, refuse to lay this chain
                        upon your mind, but tell yourself with quiet certainty:<blockquote>
                            <para>This will not tempt me to delay                                    myself.</para>
                            <para>The world I see holds nothing that I                                    want.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 129. Beyond this world there is a world I want.</title>
                    <para>This is the thought that follows from the one we practiced yesterday. You
                        cannot stop with the idea the world is worthless, for unless you see that
                        there is something else to hope for, you will only be depressed. Our
                        emphasis is not on giving up the world, but on exchanging it for what is far
                        more satisfying, filled with joy, and capable of offering you peace. Think
                        you this world can offer that to you?</para>
                    <para>It might be worth a little time to think once more about the value of this
                        world. Perhaps you will concede there is no loss in letting go all thought
                        of value here. The world you see is merciless indeed, unstable, cruel,
                        unconcerned with you, quick to avenge and pitiless with hate. It gives but
                        to rescind, and takes away all things that you have cherished for a while.
                        No lasting love is found, for none is here. This is the world of time, where
                        all things end.</para>
                    <para>Is it a loss to find a world instead where losing is impossible; where
                        love endures forever, hate cannot exist and vengeance has no meaning? Is it
                        loss to find all things you really want, and know they have no ending and
                        they will remain exactly as you want them throughout time? Yet even they
                        will be exchanged at last for what we cannot speak of, for you go from there
                        to where words fail entirely, into a silence where the language is unspoken
                        and yet surely understood.</para>
                    <para>Communication, unambiguous and plain as day, remains unlimited for all
                        eternity. And God Himself speaks to His Son, as His Son speaks to Him. Their
                        language has no words, for what They say cannot be symbolized. Their
                        knowledge is direct and wholly shared and wholly one. How far away from this
                        are you who stay bound to this world. And yet how near are you, when you
                        exchange it for the world you want.</para>
                    <para>Now is the last step certain; now you stand an instant's space away from
                        timelessness. Here can you but look forward, never back to see again the
                        world you do not want. Here is the world that comes to take its place, as
                        you unbind your mind from little things the world sets forth to keep you
                        prisoner. Value them not, and they will disappear. Esteem them, and they
                        will seem real to you.</para>
                    <para>Such is the choice. What loss can be for you in choosing not to value
                        nothingness? This world holds nothing that you really want, but what you
                        choose instead you want indeed! Let it be given you today. It waits but for
                        your choosing it, to take the place of all the things you seek but do not
                        want.</para>
                    <para>Practice your willingness to make this change ten minutes in the morning
                        and at night, and once more in between. Begin with this:<blockquote>
                            <para>Beyond this world there is a world I                                    want.</para>
                            <para>I choose to see that world instead of                                    this,</para>
                            <para>for here is nothing that I really                                    want.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>Then close your eyes upon the world you see, and in the silent darkness
                        watch the lights that are not of this world light one by one, until where
                        one begins another ends loses all meaning as they blend in one.</para>
                    <para>Today the lights of Heaven bend to you, to shine upon your eyelids as you
                        rest beyond the world of darkness. Here is light your eyes can not behold.
                        And yet your mind can see it plainly, and can understand. A day of grace is
                        given you today, and we give thanks. This day we realize that what you
                        feared to lose was only loss.</para>
                    <para>Now do we understand there is no loss. For we have seen its opposite at
                        last, and we are grateful that the choice is made. Remember your decision
                        hourly, and take a moment to confirm your choice by laying by whatever
                        thoughts you have, and dwelling briefly only upon this:<blockquote>
                            <para>The world I see holds nothing that I                                    want.</para>
                            <para>Beyond this world there is a world I                                    want.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 130. It is impossible to see two worlds.</title>
                    <para>Perception is consistent. What you see reflects your thinking. And your
                        thinking but reflects your choice of what you want to see. Your values are
                        determiners of this, for what you value you must want to see, believing what
                        you see is really there. No one can see a world his mind has not accorded
                        value. And no one can fail to look upon what he believes he wants.</para>
                    <para>Yet who can really hate and love at once? Who can desire what he does not
                        want to have reality? And who can choose to see a world of which he is
                        afraid? Fear must make blind, for this its weapon is: That which you fear to
                        see you cannot see. Love and perception thus go hand in hand, but fear
                        obscures in darkness what is there.</para>
                    <para>What, then, can fear project upon the world? What can be seen in darkness
                        that is real? Truth is eclipsed by fear, and what remains is but imagined.
                        Yet what can be real in blind imaginings of panic born? What would you want
                        that this is shown to you? What would you wish to keep in such a
                        dream?</para>
                    <para>Fear has made everything you think you see. All separation, all
                        distinctions, and the multitude of differences you believe make up the
                        world. They are not there. Love's enemy has made them up. Yet love can have
                        no enemy, and so they have no cause, no being and no consequence. They can
                        be valued, but remain unreal. They can be sought, but they can not be found.
                        Today we will not seek for them, nor waste this day in seeking what can not
                        be found.</para>
                    <para>It is impossible to see two worlds which have no overlap of any kind. Seek
                        for the one; the other disappears. But one remains. They are the range of
                        choice beyond which your decision cannot go. The real and the unreal are all
                        there are to choose between, and nothing more than these.</para>
                    <para>Today we will attempt no compromise where none is possible. The world you
                        see is proof you have already made a choice as all-embracing as its
                        opposite. What we would learn today is more than just the lesson that you
                        cannot see two worlds. It also teaches that the one you see is quite
                        consistent from the point of view from which you see it. It is all a piece
                        because it stems from one emotion, and reflects its source in everything you
                        see.</para>
                    <para>Six times today, in thanks and gratitude, we gladly give five minutes to
                        the thought that ends all compromise and doubt, and go beyond them all as
                        one. We will not make a thousand meaningless distinctions, nor attempt to
                        bring with us a little part of unreality, as we devote our minds to finding
                        only what is real.</para>
                    <para>Begin your searching for the other world by asking for a strength beyond
                        your own, and recognizing what it is you seek. You do not want illusions.
                        And you come to these five minutes emptying your hands of all the petty
                        treasures of this world. You wait for God to help you, as you say:<blockquote>

                    <para>God will be there. For you have called upon the great unfailing power
                        which will take this giant step with you in gratitude. Nor will you fail to
                        see His thanks expressed in tangible perception and in truth. You will not
                        doubt what you will look upon, for though it is perception, it is not the
                        kind of seeing that your eyes alone have ever seen before. And you will know
                        God's strength upheld you as you made this choice.</para>
                    <para>Dismiss temptation easily today whenever it arises, merely by remembering
                        the limits of your choice. The unreal or the real, the false or true is what
                        you see and only what you see. Perception is consistent with your choice,
                        and hell or Heaven comes to you as one.</para>
                    <para>Accept a little part of hell as real, and you have damned your eyes and
                        cursed your sight, and what you will behold is hell indeed. Yet the release
                        of Heaven still remains within your range of choice, to take the place of
                        everything that hell would show to you. All you need say to any part of
                        hell, whatever form it takes, is simply this:<blockquote>
                            <para>It is impossible to see two                                    worlds.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 131. No one can fail who seeks to reach the truth.</title>
                    <para>Failure is all about you while you seek for goals that cannot be achieved.
                        You look for permanence in the impermanent, for love where there is none,
                        for safety in the midst of danger; immortality within the darkness of the
                        dream of death. Who could succeed where contradiction is the setting of his
                        searching, and the place to which he comes to find stability?</para>
                    <para>Goals that are meaningless are not attained. There is no way to reach
                        them, for the means by which you strive for them are meaningless as they
                        are. Who can use such senseless means, and hope through them to gain in
                        anything? Where can they lead? And what could they achieve that offers any
                        hope of being real? Pursuit of the imagined leads to death because it is the
                        search for nothingness, and while you seek for life you ask for death. You
                        look for safety and security, while in your heart you pray for danger and
                        protection for the little dream you made.</para>
                    <para>Yet searching is inevitable here. For this you came, and you will surely
                        do the thing you came for. But the world can not dictate the goal for which
                        you search, unless you give it power to do so. Otherwise, you still are free
                        to choose a goal that lies beyond the world and every worldly thought, and
                        one that comes to you from an idea relinquished yet remembered, old yet new;
                        an echo of a heritage forgot, yet holding everything you really want.</para>
                    <para>Be glad that search you must. Be glad as well to learn you search for
                        Heaven, and must find the goal you really want. No one can fail to want this
                        goal and reach it in the end. God's Son can not seek vainly, though he try
                        to force delay, deceive himself and think that it is hell he seeks. When he
                        is wrong, he finds correction. When he wanders off, he is led back to his
                        appointed task.</para>
                    <para>No one remains in hell, for no one can abandon his Creator, nor affect His
                        perfect, timeless and unchanging Love. You will find Heaven. Everything you
                        seek but this will fall away. Yet not because it has been taken from you. It
                        will go because you do not want it. You will reach the goal you really want
                        as certainly as God created you in sinlessness.</para>
                    <para>Why wait for Heaven? It is here today. Time is the great illusion it is
                        past or in the future. Yet this cannot be, if it is where God wills His Son
                        to be. How could the Will of God be in the past, or yet to happen? What He
                        wills is now, without a past and wholly futureless. It is as far removed
                        from time as is a tiny candle from a distant star, or what you chose from
                        what you really want.</para>
                    <para>Heaven remains your one alternative to this strange world you made and all
                        its ways; its shifting patterns and uncertain goals, its painful pleasures
                        and its tragic joys. God made no contradictions. What denies its own
                        existence and attacks itself is not of Him. He did not make two minds, with
                        Heaven as the glad effect of one, and earth the other's sorry outcome which
                        is Heaven's opposite in every way.</para>
                    <para>God does not suffer conflict. Nor is His creation split in two. How could
                        it be His Son could be in hell, when God Himself established him in Heaven?
                        Could he lose what the Eternal Will has given him to be his home forever?
                        Let us not try longer to impose an alien will upon God's single purpose. He
                        is here because He wills to be, and what He wills is present now, beyond the
                        reach of time.</para>
                    <para>Today we will not choose a paradox in place of truth. How could the Son of
                        God make time to take away the Will of God? He thus denies himself, and
                        contradicts what has no opposite. He thinks he made a hell opposing Heaven,
                        and believes that he abides in what does not exist, while Heaven is the
                        place he cannot find.</para>
                    <para>Leave foolish thoughts like these behind today, and turn your mind to true
                        ideas instead. No one can fail who seeks to reach the truth, and it is truth
                        we seek to reach today. We will devote ten minutes to this goal three times
                        today, and we will ask to see the rising of the real world to replace the
                        foolish images that we hold dear, with true ideas arising in the place of
                        thoughts that have no meaning, no effect, and neither source nor substance
                        in the truth.</para>
                    <para>This we acknowledge as we start upon our practice periods. Begin with this:<blockquote>
                            <para>I ask to see a different world, and think                                    a different kind of thought from those I made.</para>
                            <para>The world I seek I did not make alone, the                                    thoughts I want to think are not my own.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>For several minutes watch your mind and see, although your eyes are
                        closed, the senseless world you think is real. Review the thoughts as well
                        which are compatible with such a world, and which you think are true. Then
                        let them go, and sink below them to the holy place where they can enter not.
                        There is a door beneath them in your mind, which you could not completely
                        lock to hide what lies beyond.</para>
                    <para>Seek for that door and find it. But before you try to open it, remind
                        yourself no one can fail who seeks to reach the truth. And it is this
                        request you make today. Nothing but this has any meaning now; no other goal
                        is valued now nor sought, nothing before this door you really want, and only
                        what lies past it do you seek.</para>
                    <para>Put out your hand, and see how easily the door swings open with your one
                        intent to go beyond it. Angels light the way, so that all darkness vanishes,
                        and you are standing in a light so bright and clear that you can understand
                        all things you see. A tiny moment of surprise, perhaps, will make you pause
                        before you realize the world you see before you in the light reflects the
                        truth you knew, and did not quite forget in wandering away in dreams.</para>
                    <para>You cannot fail today. There walks with you the Spirit Heaven sent you,
                        that you might approach this door some day, and through His aid slip
                        effortlessly past it, to the light. Today that day has come. Today God keeps
                        His ancient promise to His holy Son, as does His Son remember his to Him.
                        This is a day of gladness, for we come to the appointed time and place where
                        you will find the goal of all your searching here, and all the seeking of
                        the world, which end together as you pass beyond the door.</para>
                    <para>Remember often that today should be a time of special gladness, and
                        refrain from dismal thoughts and meaningless laments. Salvation's time has
                        come. Today is set by Heaven itself to be a time of grace for you and for
                        the world. If you forget this happy fact, remind yourself with this:<blockquote>
                            <para>Today I seek and find all that I                                    want.</para>
                            <para>My single purpose offers it to                                    me.</para>
                            <para>No one can fail who seeks to reach the                                    truth.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 132. I loose the world from all I thought it was.</title>
                    <para>What keeps the world in chains but your beliefs? And what can save the
                        world except your Self? Belief is powerful indeed. The thoughts you hold are
                        mighty, and illusions are as strong in their effects as is the truth. A
                        madman thinks the world he sees is real, and does not doubt it. Nor can he
                        be swayed by questioning his thoughts' effects. It is but when their source
                        is raised to question that the hope of freedom comes to him at last.</para>
                    <para>Yet is salvation easily achieved, for anyone is free to change his mind,
                        and all his thoughts change with it. Now the source of thought has shifted,
                        for to change your mind means you have changed the source of all ideas you
                        think or ever thought or yet will think. You free the past from what you
                        thought before. You free the future from all ancient thoughts of seeking
                        what you do not want to find.</para>
                    <para>The present now remains the only time. Here in the present is the world
                        set free. For as you let the past be lifted and release the future from your
                        ancient fears, you find escape and give it to the world. You have enslaved
                        the world with all your fears, your doubts and miseries, your pain and
                        tears, and all your sorrows press on it, and keep the world a prisoner to
                        your beliefs. Death strikes it everywhere because you hold the bitter
                        thoughts of death within your mind.</para>
                    <para>The world is nothing in itself. Your mind must give it meaning. And what
                        you behold upon it are your wishes, acted out so you can look on them and
                        think them real. Perhaps you think you did not make the world, but came
                        unwillingly to what was made already, hardly waiting for your thoughts to
                        give it meaning. Yet in truth you found exactly what you looked for when you
                        came.</para>
                    <para>There is no world apart from what you wish, and herein lies your ultimate
                        release. Change but your mind on what you want to see, and all the world
                        must change accordingly. Ideas leave not their source. This central theme is
                        often stated in the text, and must be borne in mind if you would understand
                        the lesson for today. It is not pride which tells you that you made the
                        world you see, and that it changes as you change your mind.</para>
                    <para>But it is pride that argues you have come into a world quite separate from
                        yourself, impervious to what you think, and quite apart from what you chance
                        to think it is. There is no world! This is the central thought the course
                        attempts to teach. Not everyone is ready to accept it, and each one must go
                        as far as he can let himself be led along the road to truth. He will return
                        and go still farther, or perhaps step back a while and then return
                        again.</para>
                    <para>But healing is the gift of those who are prepared to learn there is no
                        world, and can accept the lesson now. Their readiness will bring the lesson
                        to them in some form which they can understand and recognize. Some see it
                        suddenly on point of death, and rise to teach it. Others find it in
                        experience that is not of this world, which shows them that the world does
                        not exist because what they behold must be the truth, and yet it clearly
                        contradicts the world.</para>
                    <para>And some will find it in this course, and in the exercises that we do
                        today. Today's idea is true because the world does not exist. And if it is
                        indeed your own imagining, then you can loose it from all things you ever
                        thought it was by merely changing all the thoughts that gave it these
                        appearances. The sick are healed as you let go all thoughts of sickness, and
                        the dead arise when you let thoughts of life replace all thoughts you ever
                        held of death.</para>
                    <para>A lesson earlier repeated once must now be stressed again, for it contains
                        the firm foundation for today's idea. You are as God created you. There is
                        no place where you can suffer, and no time that can bring change to your
                        eternal state. How can a world of time and place exist, if you remain as God
                        created you?</para>
                    <para>What is the lesson for today except another way of saying that to know
                        your Self is the salvation of the world? To free the world from every kind
                        of pain is but to change your mind about yourself. There is no world apart
                        from your ideas because ideas leave not their source, and you maintain the
                        world within your mind in thought.</para>
                    <para>Yet if you are as God created you, you cannot think apart from Him, nor
                        make what does not share His timelessness and Love. Are these inherent in
                        the world you see? Does it create like Him? Unless it does, it is not real,
                        and cannot be at all. If you are real the world you see is false, for God's
                        creation is unlike the world in every way. And as it was His Thought by
                        which you were created, so it is your thoughts which made it and must set it
                        free, that you may know the Thoughts you share with God.</para>
                    <para>Release the world! Your real creations wait for this release to give you
                        fatherhood, not of illusions, but as God in truth. God shares His Fatherhood
                        with you who are His Son, for He makes no distinctions in what is Himself
                        and what is still Himself. What He creates is not apart from Him, and
                        nowhere does the Father end, the Son begin as something separate from
                        Him.</para>
                    <para>There is no world because it is a thought apart from God, and made to
                        separate the Father and the Son, and break away a part of God Himself and
                        thus destroy His Wholeness. Can a world which comes from this idea be real?
                        Can it be anywhere? Deny illusions, but accept the truth. Deny you are a
                        shadow briefly laid upon a dying world. Release your mind, and you will look
                        upon a world released.</para>
                    <para>Today our purpose is to free the world from all the idle thoughts we ever
                        held about it, and about all living things we see upon it. They can not be
                        there. No more can we. For we are in the home our Father set for us, along
                        with them. And we who are as He created us would loose the world this day
                        from every one of our illusions, that we may be free.</para>
                    <para>Begin the fifteen-minute periods in which we practice twice today with this:<blockquote>
                            <para>I who remain as God created me would loose                                    the world from all I thought it was.</para>
                            <para>For I am real because the world is not,                                    and I would know my own reality.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>Then merely rest, alert but with no strain, and let your mind in quietness
                        be changed so that the world is freed, along with you.</para>
                    <para>You need not realize that healing comes to many brothers far across the
                        world, as well as to the ones you see nearby, as you send out these thoughts
                        to bless the world. But you will sense your own release, although you may
                        not fully understand as yet that you could never be released alone.</para>
                    <para>Throughout the day, increase the freedom sent through your ideas to all
                        the world, and say whenever you are tempted to deny the power of your simple
                        change of mind:<blockquote>
                            <para>I loose the world from all I thought it                                    was,</para>
                            <para>and choose my own reality                                    instead.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 133. I will not value what is valueless.</title>
                    <para>Sometimes in teaching there is benefit, particularly after you have gone
                        through what seems theoretical and far from what the student has already
                        learned, to bring him back to practical concerns. This we will do today. We
                        will not speak of lofty, world-encompassing ideas, but dwell instead on
                        benefits to you.</para>
                    <para>You do not ask too much of life, but far too little. When you let your
                        mind be drawn to bodily concerns, to things you buy, to eminence as valued
                        by the world, you ask for sorrow, not for happiness. This course does not
                        attempt to take from you the little that you have. It does not try to
                        substitute utopian ideas for satisfactions which the world contains. There
                        are no satisfactions in the world.</para>
                    <para>Today we list the real criteria by which to test all things you think you
                        want. Unless they meet these sound requirements, they are not worth desiring
                        at all, for they can but replace what offers more. The laws that govern
                        choice you cannot make, no more than you can make alternatives from which to
                        choose. The choosing you can do; indeed, you must. But it is wise to learn
                        the laws you set in motion when you choose, and what alternatives you choose
                        between.</para>
                    <para>We have already stressed there are but two, however many there appear to
                        be. The range is set, and this we cannot change. It would be most ungenerous
                        to you to let alternatives be limitless, and thus delay your final choice
                        until you had considered all of them in time; and not been brought so
                        clearly to the place where there is but one choice that must be made.</para>
                    <para>Another kindly and related law is that there is no compromise in what your
                        choice must bring. It cannot give you just a little, for there is no in
                        between. Each choice you make brings everything to you or nothing.
                        Therefore, if you learn the tests by which you can distinguish everything
                        from nothing, you will make the better choice.</para>
                    <para>First, if you choose a thing that will not last forever, what you chose is
                        valueless. A temporary value is without all value. Time can never take away
                        a value that is real. What fades and dies was never there, and makes no
                        offering to him who chooses it. He is deceived by nothing in a form he
                        thinks he likes.</para>
                    <para>Next, if you choose to take a thing away from someone else, you will have
                        nothing left. This is because, when you deny his right to everything, you
                        have denied your own. You therefore will not recognize the things you really
                        have, denying they are there. Who seeks to take away has been deceived by
                        the illusion loss can offer gain. Yet loss must offer loss, and nothing
                        more.</para>
                    <para>Your next consideration is the one on which the others rest. Why is the
                        choice you make of value to you? What attracts your mind to it? What purpose
                        does it serve? Here it is easiest of all to be deceived. For what the ego
                        wants it fails to recognize. It does not even tell the truth as it perceives
                        it, for it needs to keep the halo which it uses to protect its goals from
                        tarnish and from rust, that you may see how "innocent" it is.</para>
                    <para>Yet is its camouflage a thin veneer, which could deceive but those who are
                        content to be deceived. Its goals are obvious to anyone who cares to look
                        for them. Here is deception doubled, for the one who is deceived will not
                        perceive that he has merely failed to gain. He will believe that he has
                        served the ego's hidden goals.</para>
                    <para>Yet though he tries to keep its halo clear within his vision, still must
                        he perceive its tarnished edges and its rusted core. His ineffectual
                        mistakes appear as sins to him, because he looks upon the tarnish as his
                        own; the rust a sign of deep unworthiness within himself. He who would still
                        preserve the ego's goals and serve them as his own makes no mistakes,
                        according to the dictates of his guide. This guidance teaches it is error to
                        believe that sins are but mistakes, for who would suffer for his sins if
                        this were so?</para>
                    <para>And so we come to the criterion for choice that is the hardest to believe,
                        because its obviousness is overlaid with many levels of obscurity. If you
                        feel any guilt about your choice, you have allowed the ego's goals to come
                        between the real alternatives. And thus you do not realize there are but
                        two, and the alternative you think you chose seems fearful, and too
                        dangerous to be the nothingness it actually is.</para>
                    <para>All things are valuable or valueless, worthy or not of being sought at
                        all, entirely desirable or not worth the slightest effort to obtain.
                        Choosing is easy just because of this. Complexity is nothing but a screen of
                        smoke, which hides the very simple fact that no decision can be difficult.
                        What is the gain to you in learning this? It is far more than merely letting
                        you make choices easily and without pain.</para>
                    <para>Heaven itself is reached with empty hands and open minds, which come with
                        nothing to find everything and claim it as their own. We will attempt to
                        reach this state today, with self-deception laid aside, and with an honest
                        willingness to value but the truly valuable and the real. Our two extended
                        practice periods of fifteen minutes each begin with this:<blockquote>
                            <para>I will not value what is                                    valueless,</para>
                            <para>and only what has value do I                                    seek,</para>
                            <para>for only that do I desire to                                    find.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>And then receive what waits for everyone who reaches, unencumbered, to the
                        gate of Heaven, which swings open as he comes. Should you begin to let
                        yourself collect some needless burdens, or believe you see some difficult
                        decisions facing you, be quick to answer with this simple thought:<blockquote>
                            <para>I will not value what is                                    valueless,</para>
                            <para>for what is valuable belongs to                                    me.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>

                <section xml:id="L134">
                    <title>Lesson 134. Let me perceive forgiveness as it is.</title>
                    <para>Let us review the meaning of "forgive," for it is apt to be distorted and
                        to be perceived as something that entails an unfair sacrifice of righteous
                        wrath, a gift unjustified and undeserved, and a complete denial of the
                        truth. In such a view, forgiveness must be seen as mere eccentric folly, and
                        this course appear to rest salvation on a whim.</para>
                    <para>This twisted view of what forgiveness means is easily corrected, when you
                        can accept the fact that pardon is not asked for what is true. It must be
                        limited to what is false. It is irrelevant to everything except illusions.
                        Truth is God's creation, and to pardon that is meaningless. All truth
                        belongs to Him, reflects His laws and radiates His Love. Does this need
                        pardon? How can you forgive the sinless and eternally benign?</para>
                    <para>The major difficulty that you find in genuine forgiveness on your part is
                        that you still believe you must forgive the truth, and not illusions. You
                        conceive of pardon as a vain attempt to look past what is there; to overlook
                        the truth, in an unfounded effort to deceive yourself by making an illusion
                        true. This twisted viewpoint but reflects the hold that the idea of sin
                        retains as yet upon your mind, as you regard yourself.</para>
                    <para>Because you think your sins are real, you look on pardon as deception. For
                        it is impossible to think of sin as true and not believe forgiveness is a
                        lie. Thus is forgiveness really but a sin, like all the rest. It says the
                        truth is false, and smiles on the corrupt as if they were as blameless as
                        the grass; as white as snow. It is delusional in what it thinks it can
                        accomplish. It would see as right the plainly wrong; the loathsome as the
                        good.</para>
                    <para>Pardon is no escape in such a view. It merely is a further sign that sin
                        is unforgivable, at best to be concealed, denied or called another name, for
                        pardon is a treachery to truth. Guilt cannot be forgiven. If you sin, your
                        guilt is everlasting. Those who are forgiven from the view their sins are
                        real are pitifully mocked and twice condemned; first, by themselves for what
                        they think they did, and once again by those who pardon them.</para>
                    <para>It is sin's unreality that makes forgiveness natural and wholly sane, a
                        deep relief to those who offer it; a quiet blessing where it is received. It
                        does not countenance illusions, but collects them lightly, with a little
                        laugh, and gently lays them at the feet of truth. And there they disappear
                        entirely.</para>
                    <para>Forgiveness is the only thing that stands for truth in the illusions of
                        the world. It sees their nothingness, and looks straight through the
                        thousand forms in which they may appear. It looks on lies, but it is not
                        deceived. It does not heed the self-accusing shrieks of sinners mad with
                        guilt. It looks on them with quiet eyes, and merely says to them, "My
                        brother, what you think is not the truth."</para>
                    <para>The strength of pardon is its honesty, which is so uncorrupted that it
                        sees illusions as illusions, not as truth. It is because of this that it
                        becomes the undeceiver in the face of lies; the great restorer of the simple
                        truth. By its ability to overlook what is not there, it opens up the way to
                        truth, which has been blocked by dreams of guilt. Now are you free to follow
                        in the way your true forgiveness opens up to you. For if one brother has
                        received this gift of you, the door is open to yourself.</para>
                    <para>There is a very simple way to find the door to true forgiveness, and
                        perceive it open wide in welcome. When you feel that you are tempted to
                        accuse someone of sin in any form, do not allow your mind to dwell on what
                        you think he did, for that is self-deception. Ask instead, "Would I accuse
                        myself of doing this?"</para>
                    <para>Thus will you see alternatives for choice in terms that render choosing
                        meaningful, and keep your mind as free of guilt and pain as God Himself
                        intended it to be, and as it is in truth. It is but lies that would condemn.
                        In truth is innocence the only thing there is. Forgiveness stands between
                        illusions and the truth; between the world you see and that which lies
                        beyond; between the hell of guilt and Heaven's gate.</para>
                    <para>Across this bridge, as powerful as love which laid its blessing on it, are
                        all dreams of evil and of hatred and attack brought silently to truth. They
                        are not kept to swell and bluster, and to terrify the foolish dreamer who
                        believes in them. He has been gently wakened from his dream by understanding
                        what he thought he saw was never there. And now he cannot feel that all
                        escape has been denied to him.</para>
                    <para>He does not have to fight to save himself. He does not have to kill the
                        dragons which he thought pursued him. Nor need he erect the heavy walls of
                        stone and iron doors he thought would make him safe. He can remove the
                        ponderous and useless armor made to chain his mind to fear and misery. His
                        step is light, and as he lifts his foot to stride ahead a star is left
                        behind, to point the way to those who follow him.</para>
                    <para>Forgiveness must be practiced, for the world cannot perceive its meaning,
                        nor provide a guide to teach you its beneficence. There is no thought in all
                        the world that leads to any understanding of the laws it follows, nor the
                        Thought that it reflects. It is as alien to the world as is your own
                        reality. And yet it joins your mind with the reality in you.</para>
                    <para>Today we practice true forgiveness, that the time of joining be no more
                        delayed. For we would meet with our reality in freedom and in peace. Our
                        practicing becomes the footsteps lighting up the way for all our brothers,
                        who will follow us to the reality we share with them. That this may be
                        accomplished, let us give a quarter of an hour twice today, and spend it
                        with the Guide Who understands the meaning of forgiveness, and was sent to
                        us to teach it. Let us ask of Him:<blockquote>
                            <para>Let me perceive forgiveness as it is.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>Then choose one brother as He will direct, and catalogue his "sins," as
                        one by one they cross your mind. Be certain not to dwell on any one of them,
                        but realize that you are using his "offenses" but to save the world from all
                        ideas of sin. Briefly consider all the evil things you thought of him, and
                        each time ask yourself, "Would I condemn myself for doing this?"</para>
                    <para>Let him be freed from all the thoughts you had of sin in him. And now you
                        are prepared for freedom. If you have been practicing thus far in
                        willingness and honesty, you will begin to sense a lifting up, a lightening
                        of weight across your chest, a deep and certain feeling of relief. The time
                        remaining should be given to experiencing the escape from all the heavy
                        chains you sought to lay upon your brother, but were laid upon
                        yourself.</para>
                    <para>Forgiveness should be practiced through the day, for there will still be
                        many times when you forget its meaning and attack yourself. When this
                        occurs, allow your mind to see through this illusion as you tell yourself:<blockquote>
                            <para>Let me perceive forgiveness as it                                    is.</para>
                            <para>Would I accuse myself of doing                                    this?</para>
                            <para>I will not lay this chain upon                                    myself.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>In everything you do remember this:<blockquote>
                            <para>No one is crucified                                alone,</para>
                            <para>and yet no one can enter Heaven by                                    himself.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 135. If I defend myself I am attacked.</title>
                    <para>Who would defend himself unless he thought he were attacked, that the
                        attack were real, and that his own defense could save himself? And herein
                        lies the folly of defense; it gives illusions full reality, and then
                        attempts to handle them as real. It adds illusions to illusions, thus making
                        correction doubly difficult. And it is this you do when you attempt to plan
                        the future, activate the past, or organize the present as you wish.</para>
                    <para>You operate from the belief you must protect yourself from what is
                        happening because it must contain what threatens you. A sense of threat is
                        an acknowledgment of an inherent weakness; a belief that there is danger
                        which has power to call on you to make appropriate defense. The world is
                        based on this insane belief. And all its structures, all its thoughts and
                        doubts, its penalties and heavy armaments, its legal definitions and its
                        codes, its ethics and its leaders and its gods, all serve but to preserve
                        its sense of threat. For no one walks the world in armature but must have
                        terror striking at his heart.</para>
                    <para>Defense is frightening. It stems from fear, increasing fear as each
                        defense is made. You think it offers safety. Yet it speaks of fear made real
                        and terror justified. Is it not strange you do not pause to ask, as you
                        elaborate your plans and make your armor thicker and your locks more tight,
                        what you defend, and how, and against what?</para>
                    <para>Let us consider first what you defend. It must be something that is very
                        weak and easily assaulted. It must be something made easy prey, unable to
                        protect itself and needing your defense. What but the body has such frailty
                        that constant care and watchful, deep concern are needful to protect its
                        little life? What but the body falters and must fail to serve the Son of God
                        as worthy host?</para>
                    <para>Yet it is not the body that can fear, nor be a thing of fear. It has no
                        needs but those which you assign to it. It needs no complicated structures
                        of defense, no health-inducing medicine, no care and no concern at all.
                        Defend its life, or give it gifts to make it beautiful or walls to make it
                        safe, and you but say your home is open to the thief of time, corruptible
                        and crumbling, so unsafe it must be guarded with your very life.</para>
                    <para>Is not this picture fearful? Can you be at peace with such a concept of
                        your home? Yet what endowed the body with the right to serve you thus except
                        your own belief? It is your mind which gave the body all the functions that
                        you see in it, and set its value far beyond a little pile of dust and water.
                        Who would make defense of something that he recognized as this?</para>
                    <para>The body is in need of no defense. This cannot be too often emphasized. It
                        will be strong and healthy if the mind does not abuse it by assigning it to
                        roles it cannot fill, to purposes beyond its scope, and to exalted aims
                        which it cannot accomplish. Such attempts, ridiculous yet deeply cherished,
                        are the sources for the many mad attacks you make upon it. For it seems to
                        fail your hopes, your needs, your values and your dreams.</para>
                    <para>The "self" that needs protection is not real. The body, valueless and
                        hardly worth the least defense, need merely be perceived as quite apart from
                        you, and it becomes a healthy, serviceable instrument through which the mind
                        can operate until its usefulness is over. Who would want to keep it when its
                        usefulness is done?</para>
                    <para>Defend the body and you have attacked your mind. For you have seen in it
                        the faults, the weaknesses, the limits and the lacks from which you think
                        the body must be saved. You will not see the mind as separate from bodily
                        conditions. And you will impose upon the body all the pain that comes from
                        the conception of the mind as limited and fragile, and apart from other
                        minds and separate from its Source.</para>
                    <para>These are the thoughts in need of healing, and the body will respond with
                        health when they have been corrected and replaced with truth. This is the
                        body's only real defense. Yet is this where you look for its defense? You
                        offer it protection of a kind from which it gains no benefit at all, but
                        merely adds to your distress of mind. You do not heal, but merely take away
                        the hope of healing, for you fail to see where hope must lie if it be
                        meaningful.</para>
                    <para>A healed mind does not plan. It carries out the plans that it receives
                        through listening to wisdom that is not its own. It waits until it has been
                        taught what should be done, and then proceeds to do it. It does not depend
                        upon itself for anything except its adequacy to fulfill the plans assigned
                        to it. It is secure in certainty that obstacles can not impede its progress
                        to accomplishment of any goal that serves the greater plan established for
                        the good of everyone.</para>
                    <para>A healed mind is relieved of the belief that it must plan, although it
                        cannot know the outcome which is best, the means by which it is achieved,
                        nor how to recognize the problem that the plan is made to solve. It must
                        misuse the body in its plans until it recognizes this is so. But when it has
                        accepted this as true, then is it healed, and lets the body go.</para>
                    <para>Enslavement of the body to the plans the unhealed mind sets up to save
                        itself must make the body sick. It is not free to be the means of helping in
                        a plan which far exceeds its own protection, and which needs its service for
                        a little while. In this capacity is health assured. For everything the mind
                        employs for this will function flawlessly, and with the strength that has
                        been given it and cannot fail.</para>
                    <para>It is, perhaps, not easy to perceive that self-initiated plans are but
                        defenses, with the purpose all of them were made to realize. They are the
                        means by which a frightened mind would undertake its own protection, at the
                        cost of truth. This is not difficult to realize in some forms which these
                        selfdeceptions take, where the denial of reality is very obvious. Yet
                        planning is not often recognized as a defense.</para>
                    <para>The mind engaged in planning for itself is occupied in setting up control
                        of future happenings. It does not think that it will be provided for, unless
                        it makes its own provisions. Time becomes a future emphasis, to be
                        controlled by learning and experience obtained from past events and previous
                        beliefs. It overlooks the present, for it rests on the idea the past has
                        taught enough to let the mind direct its future course.</para>
                    <para>The mind that plans is thus refusing to allow for change. What it has
                        learned before becomes the basis for its future goals. Its past experience
                        directs its choice of what will happen. And it does not see that here and
                        now is everything it needs to guarantee a future quite unlike the past,
                        without a continuity of any old ideas and sick beliefs. Anticipation plays
                        no part at all, for present confidence directs the way.</para>
                    <para>Defenses are the plans you undertake to make against the truth. Their aim
                        is to select what you approve, and disregard what you consider incompatible
                        with your beliefs of your reality. Yet what remains is meaningless indeed.
                        For it is your reality that is the "threat" which your defenses would
                        attack, obscure, and take apart and crucify.</para>
                    <para>What could you not accept, if you but knew that everything that happens,
                        all events, past, present and to come, are gently planned by One Whose only
                        purpose is your good? Perhaps you have misunderstood His plan, for He would
                        never offer pain to you. But your defenses did not let you see His loving
                        blessing shine in every step you ever took. While you made plans for death,
                        He led you gently to eternal life.</para>
                    <para>Your present trust in Him is the defense that promises a future
                        undisturbed, without a trace of sorrow, and with joy that constantly
                        increases, as this life becomes a holy instant, set in time, but heeding
                        only immortality. Let no defenses but your present trust direct the future,
                        and this life becomes a meaningful encounter with the truth that only your
                        defenses would conceal.</para>
                    <para>Without defenses, you become a light which Heaven gratefully acknowledges
                        to be its own. And it will lead you on in ways appointed for your happiness
                        according to the ancient plan, begun when time was born. Your followers will
                        join their light with yours, and it will be increased until the world is
                        lighted up with joy. And gladly will our brothers lay aside their cumbersome
                        defenses, which availed them nothing and could only terrify.</para>
                    <para>We will anticipate that time today with present confidence, for this is
                        part of what was planned for us. We will be sure that everything we need is
                        given us for our accomplishment of this today. We make no plans for how it
                        will be done, but realize that our defenselessness is all that is required
                        for the truth to dawn upon our minds with certainty.</para>
                    <para>For fifteen minutes twice today we rest from senseless planning, and from
                        every thought that blocks the truth from entering our minds. Today we will
                        receive instead of plan, that we may give instead of organize. And we are
                        given truly, as we say:<blockquote>

                            <para>But in defenselessness I will be                                    strong,</para>
                            <para>and I will learn what my defenses                                    hide.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>Nothing but that. If there are plans to make, you will be told of them.
                        They may not be the plans you thought were needed, nor indeed the answers to
                        the problems which you thought confronted you. But they are answers to
                        another kind of question, which remains unanswered yet in need of answering
                        until the Answer comes to you at last.</para>
                    <para>All your defenses have been aimed at not receiving what you will receive
                        today. And in the light and joy of simple trust, you will but wonder why you
                        ever thought that you must be defended from release. Heaven asks nothing. It
                        is hell that makes extravagant demands for sacrifice. You give up nothing in
                        these times today when, undefended, you present yourself to your Creator as
                        you really are.</para>
                    <para>He has remembered you. Today we will remember Him. For this is Eastertime
                        in your salvation. And you rise again from what was seeming death and
                        hopelessness. Now is the light of hope reborn in you, for now you come
                        without defense, to learn the part for you within the plan of God. What
                        little plans or magical beliefs can still have value, when you have received
                        your function from the Voice for God Himself?</para>
                    <para>Try not to shape this day as you believe would benefit you most. For you
                        can not conceive of all the happiness that comes to you without your
                        planning. Learn today. And all the world will take this giant stride, and
                        celebrate your Eastertime with you. Throughout the day, as foolish little
                        things appear to raise defensiveness in you and tempt you to engage in
                        weaving plans, remind yourself this is a special day for learning, and

                        serve. For then he understands as well its purpose has no meaning. Being
                        causeless and without a meaningful intent of any kind, it cannot be at all.
                        When this is seen, healing is automatic. It dispels this meaningless
                        illusion by the same approach that carries all of them to truth, and merely
                        leaves them there to disappear.</para>
                    <para>Sickness is not an accident. Like all defenses, it is an insane device for
                        selfdeception. And like all the rest, its purpose is to hide reality, attack
                        it, change it, render it inept, distort it, twist it, or reduce it to a
                        little pile of unassembled parts. The aim of all defenses is to keep the
                        truth from being whole. The parts are seen as if each one were whole within
                        itself.</para>
                    <para>Defenses are not unintentional, nor are they made without awareness. They
                        are secret, magic wands you wave when truth appears to threaten what you
                        would believe. They seem to be unconscious but because of the rapidity with
                        which you choose to use them. In that second, even less, in which the choice
                        is made, you recognize exactly what you would attempt to do, and then
                        proceed to think that it is done.</para>
                    <para>Who but yourself evaluates a threat, decides escape is necessary, and sets
                        up a series of defenses to reduce the threat that has been judged as real?
                        All this cannot be done unconsciously. But afterwards, your plan requires
                        that you must forget you made it, so it seems to be external to your own
                        intent; a happening beyond your state of mind, an outcome with a real effect
                        on you, instead of one effected by yourself.</para>
                    <para>It is this quick forgetting of the part you play in making your "reality"
                        that makes defenses seem to be beyond your own control. But what you have
                        forgot can be remembered, given willingness to reconsider the decision which
                        is doubly shielded by oblivion. Your not remembering is but the sign that
                        this decision still remains in force, as far as your desires are concerned.
                        Mistake not this for fact. Defenses must make facts unrecognizable. They aim
                        at doing this, and it is this they do.</para>
                    <para>Every defense takes fragments of the whole, assembles them without regard
                        to all their true relationships, and thus constructs illusions of a whole
                        that is not there. It is this process that imposes threat, and not whatever
                        outcome may result. When parts are wrested from the whole and seen as
                        separate and wholes within themselves, they become symbols standing for
                        attack upon the whole; successful in effect, and never to be seen as whole
                        again. And yet you have forgotten that they stand but for your own decision
                        of what should be real, to take the place of what is real.</para>
                    <para>Sickness is a decision. It is not a thing that happens to you, quite
                        unsought, which makes you weak and brings you suffering. It is a choice you
                        make, a plan you lay, when for an instant truth arises in your own deluded
                        mind, and all your world appears to totter and prepare to fall. Now are you
                        sick, that truth may go away and threaten your establishments no
                        more.</para>
                    <para>How do you think that sickness can succeed in shielding you from truth?
                        Because it proves the body is not separate from you, and so you must be
                        separate from the truth. You suffer pain because the body does, and in this
                        pain are you made one with it. Thus is your "true" identity preserved, and
                        the strange, haunting thought that you might be something beyond this little
                        pile of dust silenced and stilled. For see, this dust can make you suffer,
                        twist your limbs and stop your heart, commanding you to die and cease to
                        be.</para>
                    <para>Thus is the body stronger than the truth, which asks you live, but cannot
                        overcome your choice to die. And so the body is more powerful than
                        everlasting life, Heaven more frail than hell, and God's design for the
                        salvation of His Son opposed by a decision stronger than His Will. His Son
                        is dust, the Father incomplete, and chaos sits in triumph on His
                        throne.</para>
                    <para>Such is your planning for your own defense. And you believe that Heaven
                        quails before such mad attacks as these, with God made blind by your
                        illusions, truth turned into lies, and all the universe made slave to laws
                        which your defenses would impose on it. Yet who believes illusions but the
                        one who made them up? Who else can see them and react to them as if they
                        were the truth?</para>
                    <para>God knows not of your plans to change His Will. The universe remains
                        unheeding of the laws by which you thought to govern it. And Heaven has not
                        bowed to hell, nor life to death. You can but choose to think you die, or
                        suffer sickness or distort the truth in any way. What is created is apart
                        from all of this. Defenses are plans to defeat what cannot be attacked. What
                        is unalterable cannot change. And what is wholly sinless cannot sin.</para>
                    <para>Such is the simple truth. It does not make appeal to might nor triumph. It
                        does not command obedience, nor seek to prove how pitiful and futile your
                        attempts to plan defenses that would alter it. Truth merely wants to give
                        you happiness, for such its purpose is. Perhaps it sighs a little when you
                        throw away its gifts, and yet it knows, with perfect certainty, that what
                        God wills for you must be received.</para>
                    <para>It is this fact that demonstrates that time is an illusion. For time lets
                        you think what God has given you is not the truth right now, as it must be.
                        The Thoughts of God are quite apart from time. For time is but another
                        meaningless defense you made against the truth. Yet what He wills is here,
                        and you remain as He created you.</para>
                    <para>Truth has a power far beyond defense, for no illusions can remain where
                        truth has been allowed to enter. And it comes to any mind that would lay
                        down its arms, and cease to play with folly. It is found at any time; today,
                        if you will choose to practice giving welcome to the truth.</para>
                    <para>This is our aim today. And we will give a quarter of an hour twice to ask
                        the truth to come to us and set us free. And truth will come, for it has
                        never been apart from us. It merely waits for just this invitation which we
                        give today. We introduce it with a healing prayer, to help us rise above
                        defensiveness, and let truth be as it has always been:<blockquote>
                            <para>Sickness is a defense against the                                    truth.</para>
                            <para>I will accept the truth of what I                                    am,</para>
                            <para>and let my mind be wholly healed                                    today.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>Healing will flash across your open mind, as peace and truth arise to take
                        the place of war and vain imaginings. There will be no dark corners sickness
                        can conceal, and keep defended from the light of truth. There will be no dim
                        figures from your dreams, nor their obscure and meaningless pursuits with
                        double purposes insanely sought, remaining in your mind. It will be healed
                        of all the sickly wishes that it tried to authorize the body to obey.</para>
                    <para>Now is the body healed, because the source of sickness has been opened to
                        relief. And you will recognize you practiced well by this: The body should
                        not feel at all. If you have been successful, there will be no sense of
                        feeling ill or feeling well, of pain or pleasure. No response at all is in
                        the mind to what the body does. Its usefulness remains and nothing
                        more.</para>
                    <para>Perhaps you do not realize that this removes the limits you had placed
                        upon the body by the purposes you gave to it. As these are laid aside, the
                        strength the body has will always be enough to serve all truly useful
                        purposes. The body's health is fully guaranteed, because it is not limited
                        by time, by weather or fatigue, by food and drink, or any laws you made it
                        serve before. You need do nothing now to make it well, for sickness has
                        become impossible.</para>
                    <para>Yet this protection needs to be preserved by careful watching. If you let
                        your mind harbor attack thoughts, yield to judgment or make plans against
                        uncertainties to come, you have again misplaced yourself, and made a bodily
                        identity which will attack the body, for the mind is sick.</para>
                    <para>Give instant remedy, should this occur, by not allowing your defensiveness
                        to hurt you longer. Do not be confused about what must be healed, but tell yourself:<blockquote>
                            <para>I have forgotten what I really                                    am,</para>
                            <para>for I mistook my body for                                    myself.</para>
                            <para>Sickness is a defense against the                                    truth.</para>
                            <para>But I am not a body. And my mind cannot                                    attack.</para>
                            <para>So I can not be sick.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 137. When I am healed I am not healed alone.</title>
                    <para>Today's idea remains the central thought on which salvation rests. For
                        healing is the opposite of all the world's ideas which dwell on sickness and
                        on separate states. Sickness is a retreat from others, and a shutting off of
                        joining. It becomes a door that closes on a separate self, and keeps it
                        isolated and alone.</para>
                    <para>Sickness is isolation. For it seems to keep one self apart from all the
                        rest, to suffer what the others do not feel. It gives the body final power
                        to make the separation real, and keep the mind in solitary prison, split
                        apart and held in pieces by a solid wall of sickened flesh, which it can not
                        surmount.</para>
                    <para>The world obeys the laws that sickness serves, but healing operates apart
                        from them. It is impossible that anyone be healed alone. In sickness must he
                        be apart and separate. But healing is his own decision to be one again, and
                        to accept his Self with all Its parts intact and unassailed. In sickness
                        does his Self appear to be dismembered, and without the unity that gives It
                        life. But healing is accomplished as he sees the body has no power to attack
                        the universal Oneness of God's Son.</para>
                    <para>Sickness would prove that lies must be the truth. But healing demonstrates
                        that truth is true. The separation sickness would impose has never really
                        happened. To be healed is merely to accept what always was the simple truth,
                        and always will remain exactly as it has forever been. Yet eyes accustomed
                        to illusions must be shown that what they look upon is false. So healing,
                        never needed by the truth, must demonstrate that sickness is not
                        real.</para>
                    <para>Healing might thus be called a counter-dream, which cancels out the dream
                        of sickness in the name of truth, but not in truth itself. Just as
                        forgiveness overlooks all sins that never were accomplished, healing but
                        removes illusions that have not occurred. Just as the real world will arise
                        to take the place of what has never been at all, healing but offers
                        restitution for imagined states and false ideas which dreams embroider into
                        pictures of the truth.</para>
                    <para>Yet think not healing is unworthy of your function here. For anti-Christ
                        becomes more powerful than Christ to those who dream the world is real. The
                        body seems to be more solid and more stable than the mind. And love becomes
                        a dream, while fear remains the one reality that can be seen and justified
                        and fully understood.</para>
                    <para>Just as forgiveness shines away all sin and the real world will occupy the
                        place of what you made, so healing must replace the fantasies of sickness
                        which you hold before the simple truth. When sickness has been seen to
                        disappear in spite of all the laws that hold it cannot but be real, then
                        questions have been answered. And the laws can be no longer cherished nor
                        obeyed.</para>
                    <para>Healing is freedom. For it demonstrates that dreams will not prevail
                        against the truth. Healing is shared. And by this attribute it proves that
                        laws unlike the ones which hold that sickness is inevitable are more potent
                        than their sickly opposites. Healing is strength. For by its gentle hand is
                        weakness overcome, and minds that were walled off within a body free to join
                        with other minds, to be forever strong.</para>
                    <para>Healing, forgiveness, and the glad exchange of all the world of sorrow for
                        a world where sadness cannot enter, are the means by which the Holy Spirit
                        urges you to follow Him. His gentle lessons teach how easily salvation can
                        be yours; how little practice you need undertake to let His laws replace the
                        ones you made to hold yourself a prisoner to death. His life becomes your
                        own, as you extend the little help He asks in freeing you from everything
                        that ever caused you pain.</para>
                    <para>And as you let yourself be healed, you see all those around you, or who
                        cross your mind, or whom you touch or those who seem to have no contact with
                        you, healed along with you. Perhaps you will not recognize them all, nor
                        realize how great your offering to all the world, when you let healing come
                        to you. But you are never healed alone. And legions upon legions will
                        receive the gift that you receive when you are healed.</para>
                    <para>Those who are healed become the instruments of healing. Nor does time
                        elapse between the instant they are healed, and all the grace of healing it
                        is given them to give. What is opposed to God does not exist, and who
                        accepts it not within his mind becomes a haven where the weary can remain to
                        rest. For here is truth bestowed, and here are all illusions brought to
                        truth.</para>
                    <para>Would you not offer shelter to God's Will? You but invite your Self to be
                        at home. And can this invitation be refused? Ask the inevitable to occur,
                        and you will never fail. The other choice is but to ask what cannot be to
                        be, and this can not succeed. Today we ask that only truth will occupy our
                        minds; that thoughts of healing will this day go forth from what is healed
                        to what must yet be healed, aware that they will both occur as one.</para>
                    <para>We will remember, as the hour strikes, our function is to let our minds be
                        healed, that we may carry healing to the world, exchanging curse for
                        blessing, pain for joy, and separation for the peace of God. Is not a minute
                        of the hour worth the giving to receive a gift like this? Is not a little
                        time a small expense to offer for the gift of everything?</para>
                    <para>Yet must we be prepared for such a gift. And so we will begin the day with
                        this, and give ten minutes to these thoughts with which we will conclude
                        today at night as well:<blockquote>
                            <para>When I am healed I am not healed                                    alone.</para>
                            <para>And I would share my healing with the                                    world,</para>
                            <para>that sickness may be banished from the                                    mind of God's one Son,</para>
                            <para>Who is my only Self.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>Let healing be through you this very day. And as you rest in quiet, be
                        prepared to give as you receive, to hold but what you give, and to receive
                        the Word of God to take the place of all the foolish thoughts that ever were
                        imagined. Now we come together to make well all that was sick, and offer
                        blessing where there was attack. Nor will we let this function be forgot as
                        every hour of the day slips by, remembering our purpose with this thought:<blockquote>
                            <para>When I am healed I am not healed                                    alone.</para>
                            <para>And I would bless my brothers, for I would                                    be healed with them,</para>
                            <para>as they are healed with                                me.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 138. Heaven is the decision I must make.</title>
                    <para>In this world Heaven is a choice, because here we believe there are
                        alternatives to choose between. We think that all things have an opposite,
                        and what we want we choose. If Heaven exists there must be hell as well, for
                        contradiction is the way we make what we perceive, and what we think is
                        real.</para>
                    <para>Creation knows no opposite. But here is opposition part of being "real."
                        It is this strange perception of the truth that makes the choice of Heaven
                        seem to be the same as the relinquishment of hell. It is not really thus.
                        Yet what is true in God's creation cannot enter here until it is reflected
                        in some form the world can understand. Truth cannot come where it could only
                        be perceived with fear. For this would be the error truth can be brought to
                        illusions. Opposition makes the truth unwelcome, and it cannot come.</para>
                    <para>Choice is the obvious escape from what appears as opposites. Decision lets
                        one of conflicting goals become the aim of effort and expenditure of time.
                        Without decision, time is but a waste and effort dissipated. It is spent for
                        nothing in return, and time goes by without results. There is no sense of
                        gain, for nothing is accomplished; nothing learned.</para>
                    <para>You need to be reminded that you think a thousand choices are confronting
                        you, when there is really only one to make. And even this but seems to be a
                        choice. Do not confuse yourself with all the doubts that myriad decisions
                        would induce. You make but one. And when that one is made, you will perceive
                        it was no choice at all. For truth is true, and nothing else is true. There
                        is no opposite to choose instead. There is no contradiction to the
                        truth.</para>
                    <para>Choosing depends on learning. And the truth cannot be learned, but only
                        recognized. In recognition its acceptance lies, and as it is accepted it is
                        known. But knowledge is beyond the goals we seek to teach within the
                        framework of this course. Ours are teaching goals, to be attained through
                        learning how to reach them, what they are, and what they offer you.
                        Decisions are the outcome of your learning, for they rest on what you have
                        accepted as the truth of what you are, and what your needs must be.</para>
                    <para>In this insanely complicated world, Heaven appears to take the form of
                        choice, rather than merely being what it is. Of all the choices you have
                        tried to make this is the simplest, most definitive and prototype of all the
                        rest, the one which settles all decisions. If you could decide the rest,
                        this one remains unsolved. But when you solve this one, the others are
                        resolved with it, for all decisions but conceal this one by taking different
                        forms. Here is the final and the only choice in which is truth accepted or
                        denied.</para>
                    <para>So we begin today considering the choice that time was made to help us
                        make. Such is its holy purpose, now transformed from the intent you gave it;
                        that it be a means for demonstrating hell is real, hope changes to despair,
                        and life itself must in the end be overcome by death. In death alone are
                        opposites resolved, for ending opposition is to die. And thus salvation must
                        be seen as death, for life is seen as conflict. To resolve the conflict is
                        to end your life as well.</para>
                    <para>These mad beliefs can gain unconscious hold of great intensity, and grip
                        the mind with terror and anxiety so strong that it will not relinquish its
                        ideas about its own protection. It must be saved from salvation, threatened
                        to be safe, and magically armored against truth. And these decisions are
                        made unaware, to keep them safely undisturbed; apart from question and from
                        reason and from doubt.</para>
                    <para>Heaven is chosen consciously. The choice cannot be made until alternatives
                        are accurately seen and understood. All that is veiled in shadows must be
                        raised to understanding, to be judged again, this time with Heaven's help.
                        And all mistakes in judgment that the mind had made before are open to
                        correction, as the truth dismisses them as causeless. Now are they without
                        effects. They cannot be concealed, because their nothingness is recognized. </para>
                    <para>The conscious choice of Heaven is as sure as is the ending of the fear of
                        hell, when it is raised from its protective shield of unawareness, and is
                        brought to light. Who can decide between the clearly seen and the
                        unrecognized? Yet who can fail to make a choice between alternatives when
                        only one is seen as valuable; the other as a wholly worthless thing, a but
                        imagined source of guilt and pain? Who hesitates to make a choice like this?
                        And shall we hesitate to choose today?</para>
                    <para>We make the choice for Heaven as we wake, and spend five minutes making
                        sure that we have made the one decision that is sane. We recognize we make a
                        conscious choice between what has existence and what has nothing but an
                        appearance of the truth. Its pseudo-being, brought to what is real, is
                        flimsy and transparent in the light. It holds no terror now, for what was
                        made enormous, vengeful, pitiless with hate, demands obscurity for fear to
                        be invested there. Now it is recognized as but a foolish, trivial
                        mistake.</para>
                    <para>Before we close our eyes in sleep tonight, we reaffirm the choice that we
                        have made each hour in between. And now we give the last five minutes of our
                        waking day to the decision with which we awoke. As every hour passed, we
                        have declared our choice again, in a brief quiet time devoted to maintaining
                        sanity. And finally, we close the day with this, acknowledging we chose but
                        what we want:<blockquote>
                            <para>Heaven is the decision I must                                    make.</para>
                            <para>I make it now, and will not change my                                    mind,</para>
                            <para>because it is the only thing I                                    want.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>

                    <title>Lesson 139. I will accept Atonement for myself.</title>
                    <para>Here is the end of choice. For here we come to a decision to accept
                        ourselves as God created us. And what is choice except uncertainty of what
                        we are? There is no doubt that is not rooted here. There is no question but
                        reflects this one. There is no conflict that does not entail the single,
                        simple question, "What am I?"</para>
                    <para>Yet who could ask this question except one who has refused to recognize
                        himself? Only refusal to accept yourself could make the question seem to be
                        sincere. The only thing that can be surely known by any living thing is what
                        it is. From this one point of certainty, it looks on other things as certain
                        as itself.</para>
                    <para>Uncertainty about what you must be is self-deception on a scale so vast,
                        its magnitude can hardly be conceived. To be alive and not to know yourself
                        is to believe that you are really dead. For what is life except to be
                        yourself, and what but you can be alive instead? Who is the doubter? What is
                        it he doubts? Whom does he question? Who can answer him?</para>
                    <para>He merely states that he is not himself, and therefore, being something
                        else, becomes a questioner of what that something is. Yet he could never be
                        alive at all unless he knew the answer. If he asks as if he does not know,
                        it merely shows he does not want to be the thing he is. He has accepted it
                        because he lives; has judged against it and denied its worth, and has
                        decided that he does not know the only certainty by which he lives.</para>
                    <para>Thus he becomes uncertain of his life, for what it is has been denied by
                        him. It is for this denial that you need Atonement. Your denial made no
                        change in what you are. But you have split your mind into what knows and
                        does not know the truth. You are yourself. There is no doubt of this. And
                        yet you doubt it. But you do not ask what part of you can really doubt
                        yourself. It cannot really be a part of you that asks this question. For it
                        asks of one who knows the answer. Were it part of you, then certainty would
                        be impossible.</para>
                    <para>Atonement remedies the strange idea that it is possible to doubt yourself,
                        and be unsure of what you really are. This is the depth of madness. Yet it
                        is the universal question of the world. What does this mean except the world
                        is mad? Why share its madness in the sad belief that what is universal here
                        is true?</para>
                    <para>Nothing the world believes is true. It is a place whose purpose is to be a
                        home where those who claim they do not know themselves can come to question
                        what it is they are. And they will come again until the time Atonement is
                        accepted, and they learn it is impossible to doubt yourself, and not to be
                        aware of what you are.</para>
                    <para>Only acceptance can be asked of you, for what you are is certain. It is
                        set forever in the holy Mind of God, and in your own. It is so far beyond
                        all doubt and question that to ask what it must be is all the proof you need
                        to show that you believe the contradiction that you know not what you cannot
                        fail to know. Is this a question, or a statement which denies itself in
                        statement? Let us not allow our holy minds to occupy themselves with
                        senseless musings such as this.</para>
                    <para>We have a mission here. We did not come to reinforce the madness that we
                        once believed in. Let us not forget the goal that we accepted. It is more
                        than just our happiness alone we came to gain. What we accept as what we are
                        proclaims what everyone must be, along with us. Fail not your brothers, or
                        you fail yourself. Look lovingly on them, that they may know that they are
                        part of you, and you of them.</para>
                    <para>This does Atonement teach, and demonstrates the Oneness of God's Son is
                        unassailed by his belief he knows not what he is. Today accept Atonement,
                        not to change reality, but merely to accept the truth about yourself, and go
                        your way rejoicing in the endless Love of God. It is but this that we are
                        asked to do. It is but this that we will do today.</para>
                    <para>Five minutes in the morning and at night we will devote to dedicate our
                        minds to our assignment for today. We start with this review of what our
                        mission is:</para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>
                            I will accept Atonement for                            myself,</para>
                        <para>For I remain as God created me.
                        </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>We have not lost the knowledge that God gave to us when He created us like
                        Him. We can remember it for everyone, for in creation are all minds as one.
                        And in our memory is the recall how dear our brothers are to us in truth,
                        how much a part of us is every mind, how faithful they have really been to
                        us, and how our Father's Love contains them all.</para>
                    <para>In thanks for all creation, in the Name of its Creator and His Oneness
                        with all aspects of creation, we repeat our dedication to our cause today
                        each hour, as we lay aside all thoughts that would distract us from our holy
                        aim. For several minutes let your mind be cleared of all the foolish cobwebs
                        which the world would weave around the holy Son of God. And learn the
                        fragile nature of the chains that seem to keep the knowledge of yourself
                        apart from your awareness, as you say:</para>

                        the body "better." When it tries to heal the mind, it sees no separation
                        from the body, where it thinks the mind exists. Its forms of healing thus
                        must substitute illusion for illusion. One belief in sickness takes another
                        form, and so the patient now perceives himself as well.</para>
                    <para>He is not healed. He merely had a dream that he was sick, and in the dream
                        he found a magic formula to make him well. Yet he has not awakened from the
                        dream, and so his mind remains exactly as it was before. He has not seen the
                        light that would awaken him and end the dream. What difference does the
                        content of a dream make in reality? One either sleeps or wakens. There is
                        nothing in between.</para>
                    <para>The happy dreams the Holy Spirit brings are different from the dreaming of
                        the world, where one can merely dream he is awake. The dreams forgiveness
                        lets the mind perceive do not induce another form of sleep, so that the
                        dreamer dreams another dream. His happy dreams are heralds of the dawn of
                        truth upon the mind. They lead from sleep to gentle waking, so that dreams
                        are gone. And thus they cure for all eternity.</para>
                    <para>Atonement heals with certainty, and cures all sickness. For the mind which
                        understands that sickness can be nothing but a dream is not deceived by
                        forms the dream may take. Sickness where guilt is absent cannot come, for it
                        is but another form of guilt. Atonement does not heal the sick, for that is
                        not a cure. It takes away the guilt that makes the sickness possible. And
                        that is cure indeed. For sickness now is gone, with nothing left to which it
                        can return.</para>
                    <para>Peace be to you who have been cured in God, and not in idle dreams. For
                        cure must come from holiness, and holiness can not be found where sin is
                        cherished. God abides in holy temples. He is barred where sin has entered.
                        Yet there is no place where He is not. And therefore sin can have no home in
                        which to hide from His beneficence. There is no place where holiness is not,
                        and nowhere sin and sickness can abide.</para>
                    <para>This is the thought that cures. It does not make distinctions among
                        unrealities. Nor does it seek to heal what is not sick, unmindful where the
                        need for healing is. This is no magic. It is merely an appeal to truth,
                        which cannot fail to heal and heal forever. It is not a thought that judges
                        an illusion by its size, its seeming gravity, or anything that is related to
                        the form it takes. It merely focuses on what it is, and knows that no
                        illusion can be real.</para>
                    <para>Let us not try today to seek to cure what cannot suffer sickness. Healing
                        must be sought but where it is, and then applied to what is sick, so that it
                        can be cured. There is no remedy the world provides that can effect a change
                        in anything. The mind that brings illusions to the truth is really changed.
                        There is no change but this. For how can one illusion differ from another
                        but in attributes that have no substance, no reality, no core, and nothing
                        that is truly different?</para>
                    <para>Today we seek to change our minds about the source of sickness, for we
                        seek a cure for all illusions, not another shift among them. We will try
                        today to find the source of healing, which is in our minds because our
                        Father placed it there for us. It is not farther from us than ourselves. It
                        is as near to us as our own thoughts; so close it is impossible to lose. We
                        need but seek it and it must be found.</para>
                    <para>We will not be misled today by what appears to us as sick. We go beyond
                        appearances today and reach the source of healing, from which nothing is
                        exempt. We will succeed to the extent to which we realize that there can
                        never be a meaningful distinction made between what is untrue and equally
                        untrue. Here there are no degrees, and no beliefs that what does not exist
                        is truer in some forms than others. All of them are false, and can be cured
                        because they are not true.</para>
                    <para>So do we lay aside our amulets, our charms and medicines, our chants and
                        bits of magic in whatever form they take. We will be still and listen for
                        the Voice of healing, which will cure all ills as one, restoring saneness to
                        the Son of God. No voice but this can cure. Today we hear a single Voice
                        which speaks to us of truth, where all illusions end, and peace returns to
                        the eternal, quiet home of God.</para>
                    <para>We waken hearing Him, and let Him speak to us five minutes as the day
                        begins, and end the day by listening again five minutes more before we go to
                        sleep. Our only preparation is to let our interfering thoughts be laid
                        aside, not separately, but all of them as one. They are the same. We have no
                        need to make them different, and thus delay the time when we can hear our
                        Father speak to us. We hear Him now. We come to Him today.</para>
                    <para>With nothing in our hands to which we cling, with lifted hearts and
                        listening minds we pray:</para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>Only salvation can be said to cure.                            </para>
                        <para>Speak to us, Father, that we may be                                healed.</para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>And we will feel salvation cover us with soft protection, and with peace
                        so deep that no illusion can disturb our minds, nor offer proof to us that
                        it is real. This will we learn today. And we will say our prayer for healing
                        hourly, and take a minute as the hour strikes, to hear the answer to our
                        prayer be given us as we attend in silence and in joy. This is the day when
                        healing comes to us. This is the day when separation ends, and we remember
                        Who we really are.</para>

                    <title>Review IV Introduction (Lessons 121 - 140)</title>
                    <para>Now we review again, this time aware we are preparing for the second part
                        of learning how the truth can be applied. Today we will begin to concentrate
                        on readiness for what will follow next. Such is our aim for this review, and
                        for the lessons following. Thus, we review the recent lessons and their
                        central thoughts in such a way as will facilitate the readiness that we
                        would now achieve.</para>
                    <para>There is a central theme that unifies each step in the review we
                        undertake, which can be simply stated in these words:</para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>My mind holds only what I think with                                God.</para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>That is a fact, and represents the truth of What you are and What your
                        Father is. It is this thought by which the Father gave creation to the Son,
                        establishing the Son as co-creator with Himself. It is this thought that
                        fully guarantees salvation to the Son. For in his mind no thoughts can dwell
                        but those his Father shares. Lack of forgiveness blocks this thought from
                        his awareness. Yet it is forever true.</para>
                    <para>Let us begin our preparation with some understanding of the many forms in
                        which the lack of true forgiveness may be carefully concealed. Because they
                        are illusions, they are not perceived to be but what they are; defenses that
                        protect your unforgiving thoughts from being seen and recognized. Their
                        purpose is to show you something else, and hold correction off through
                        selfdeceptions made to take its place.</para>
                    <para>And yet, your mind holds only what you think with God. Your selfdeceptions
                        cannot take the place of truth. No more than can a child who throws a stick
                        into the ocean change the coming and the going of the tides, the warming of
                        the water by the sun, the silver of the moon on it by night. So do we start
                        each practice period in this review with readying our minds to understand
                        the lessons that we read, and see the meaning that they offer us.</para>
                    <para>Begin each day with time devoted to the preparation of your mind to learn
                        what each idea you will review that day can offer you in freedom and in
                        peace. Open your mind, and clear it of all thoughts that would deceive, and
                        let this thought alone engage it fully, and remove the rest:</para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>My mind holds only what I think with                                God.</para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Five minutes with this thought will be enough to set the day along the
                        lines which God appointed, and to place His Mind in charge of all the
                        thoughts you will receive that day.</para>
                    <para>They will not come from you alone, for they will all be shared with Him.
                        And so each one will bring the message of His Love to you, returning
                        messages of yours to Him. So will communion with the Lord of Hosts be yours,
                        as He Himself has willed it be. And as His Own completion joins with Him, so
                        will He join with you who are complete as you unite with Him, and He with
                        you.</para>
                    <para>After your preparation, merely read each of the two ideas assigned to you
                        to be reviewed that day. Then close your eyes, and say them slowly to
                        yourself. There is no hurry now, for you are using time for its intended
                        purpose. Let each word shine with the meaning God has given it, as it was
                        given to you through His Voice. Let each idea which you review that day give
                        you the gift that He has laid in it for you to have of Him. And we will use
                        no format for our practicing but this:</para>
                    <para>Each hour of the day, bring to your mind the thought with which the day
                        began, and spend a quiet moment with it. Then repeat the two ideas you
                        practice for the day unhurriedly, with time enough to see the gifts that
                        they contain for you, and let them be received where they were meant to
                        be.</para>
                    <para>We add no other thoughts, but let these be the messages they are. We need
                        no more than this to give us happiness and rest, and endless quiet, perfect
                        certainty, and all our Father wills that we receive as the inheritance we
                        have of Him. Each day of practicing, as we review, we close as we began,
                        repeating first the thought that made the day a special time of blessing and
                        of happiness for us; and through our faithfulness restored the world from
                        darkness to the light, from grief to joy, from pain to peace, from sin to
                        holiness.</para>
                    <para>God offers thanks to you who practice thus the keeping of His Word. And as
                        you give your mind to the ideas for the day again before you sleep, His
                        gratitude surrounds you in the peace wherein He wills you be forever, and
                        are learning now to claim again as your inheritance.</para>

                    <para>No one can judge on partial evidence. That is not judgment. It is merely
                        an opinion based on ignorance and doubt. Its seeming certainty is but a
                        cloak for the uncertainty it would conceal. It needs irrational defense
                        because it is irrational. And its defense seems strong, convincing, and
                        without a doubt because of all the doubting underneath.</para>
                    <para>You do not seem to doubt the world you see. You do not really question
                        what is shown you through the body's eyes. Nor do you ask why you believe
                        it, even though you learned a long while since your senses do deceive. That
                        you believe them to the last detail which they report is even stranger, when
                        you pause to recollect how frequently they have been faulty witnesses
                        indeed! Why would you trust them so implicitly? <phrase
                            annotations="reminder">Why but because of underlying doubt, which you
                            would hide with show of certainty?</phrase></para>
                    <para>How can you judge? Your judgment rests upon the witness that your senses
                        offer you. Yet witness never falser was than this. But how else do you judge
                        the world you see? You place pathetic faith in what your eyes and ears
                        report. You think your fingers touch reality, and close upon the truth. This
                        is awareness that you understand, and think more real than what is witnessed
                        to by the eternal Voice for God Himself.</para>
                    <para>Can this be judgment? You have often been urged to refrain from judging,
                        not because it is a right to be withheld from you. You cannot judge. You
                        merely can believe the ego's judgments, all of which are false. It guides
                        your senses carefully, to prove how weak you are; how helpless and afraid,
                        how apprehensive of just punishment, how black with sin, how wretched in
                        your guilt.</para>
                    <para>This thing it speaks of, and would yet defend, it tells you is yourself.
                        And you believe that this is so with stubborn certainty. Yet underneath
                        remains the hidden doubt that what it shows you as reality with such
                        conviction it does not believe. It is itself alone that it condemns. It is
                        within itself it sees the guilt. It is its own despair it sees in
                        you.</para>
                    <para>Hear not its voice. The witnesses it sends to prove to you its evil is
                        your own are false, and speak with certainty of what they do not know. Your
                        faith in them is blind because you would not share the doubts their lord can
                        not completely vanquish. You believe to doubt his vassals is to doubt
                        yourself.</para>
                    <para>Yet you must learn to doubt their evidence will clear the way to recognize
                        yourself, and let the Voice for God alone be Judge of what is worthy of your
                        own belief. He will not tell you that your brother should be judged by what
                        your eyes behold in him, nor what his body's mouth says to your ears, nor
                        what your fingers' touch reports of him. He passes by such idle witnesses,
                        which merely bear false witness to God's Son. He recognizes only what God
                        loves, and in the holy light of what He sees do all the ego's dreams of what
                        you are vanish before the splendor He beholds.</para>
                    <para>Let Him be Judge of what you are, for He has certainty in which there is
                        no doubt, because it rests on Certainty so great that doubt is meaningless
                        before Its face. Christ cannot doubt Himself. The Voice for God can only
                        honor Him, rejoicing in His perfect, everlasting sinlessness. Whom He has
                        judged can only laugh at guilt, unwilling now to play with toys of sin;
                        unheeding of the body's witnesses before the rapture of Christ's holy
                        face.</para>
                    <para>And thus He judges you. Accept His Word for what you are, for He bears
                        witness to your beautiful creation, and the Mind Whose Thought created your
                        reality. What can the body mean to Him Who knows the glory of the Father and
                        the Son? What whispers of the ego can He hear? What could convince Him that
                        your sins are real? Let Him be Judge as well of everything that seems to
                        happen to you in this world. His lessons will enable you to bridge the gap
                        between illusions and the truth.</para>
                    <para>He will remove all faith that you have placed in pain, disaster, suffering
                        and loss. He gives you vision which can look beyond these grim appearances,
                        and can behold the gentle face of Christ in all of them. You will no longer
                        doubt that only good can come to you who are beloved of God, for He will
                        judge all happenings, and teach the single lesson that they all
                        contain.</para>
                    <para>He will select the elements in them which represent the truth, and
                        disregard those aspects which reflect but idle dreams. And He will
                        reinterpret all you see, and all occurrences, each circumstance, and every
                        happening that seems to touch on you in any way from His one frame of
                        reference, wholly unified and sure. And you will see the love beyond the
                        hate, the constancy in change, the pure in sin, and only Heaven's blessing
                        on the world.</para>
                    <para>Such is your resurrection, for your life is not a part of anything you
                        see. It stands beyond the body and the world, past every witness for
                        unholiness, within the Holy, holy as Itself. In everyone and everything His
                        Voice would speak to you of nothing but your Self and your Creator, Who is
                        One with Him. So will you see the holy face of Christ in everything, and
                        hear in everything no sound except the echo of God's Voice.</para>
                    <para>Such is your resurrection, for your life is not a part of anything you

                    <para>We practice wordlessly today, except at the beginning of the time we spend
                        with God. We introduce these times with but a single, slow repeating of the
                        thought with which the day begins. And then we watch our thoughts, appealing
                        silently to Him Who sees the elements of truth in them. Let Him evaluate
                        each thought that comes to mind, remove the elements of dreams, and give
                        them back again as clean ideas that do not contradict the Will of
                        God.</para>
                    <para>Give Him your thoughts, and He will give them back as miracles which
                        joyously proclaim the wholeness and the happiness God wills His Son, as
                        proof of His eternal Love. And as each thought is thus transformed, it takes
                        on healing power from the Mind which saw the truth in it, and failed to be
                        deceived by what was falsely added. All the threads of fantasy are gone. And
                        what remains is unified into a perfect Thought that offers its perfection
                        everywhere.</para>
                    <para>Spend fifteen minutes thus when you awake, and gladly give another fifteen
                        more before you go to sleep. Your ministry begins as all your thoughts are
                        purified. So are you taught to teach the Son of God the holy lesson of his
                        sanctity. No one can fail to listen, when you hear the Voice for God give
                        honor to God's Son. And everyone will share the thoughts with you which He
                        has retranslated in your mind.</para>
                    <para>Such is your Eastertide. And so you lay the gift of snow-white lilies on
                        the world, replacing witnesses to sin and death. Through your
                        transfiguration is the world redeemed, and joyfully released from guilt. Now
                        do we lift our resurrected minds in gladness and in gratitude to Him Who has
                        restored our sanity to us.</para>
                    <para>And we will hourly remember Him Who is salvation and deliverance. As we
                        give thanks, the world unites with us and happily accepts our holy thoughts,
                        which Heaven has corrected and made pure. Now has our ministry begun at
                        last, to carry round the world the joyous news that truth has no illusions,
                        and the peace of God, through us, belongs to everyone.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 152. The power of decision is my own.</title>
                    <para>No one can suffer loss unless it be his own decision. No one suffers pain
                        except his choice elects this state for him. No one can grieve nor fear nor
                        think him sick unless these are the outcomes that he wants. And no one dies
                        without his own consent. Nothing occurs but represents your wish, and
                        nothing is omitted that you choose. Here is your world, complete in all
                        details. Here is its whole reality for you. And it is only here salvation
                        is. </para>
                    <para>You may believe that this position is extreme, and too inclusive to be
                        true. Yet can truth have exceptions? If you have the gift of everything, can
                        loss be real? Can pain be part of peace, or grief of joy? Can fear and
                        sickness enter in a mind where love and perfect holiness abide? Truth must
                        be all-inclusive, if it be the truth at all. Accept no opposites and no
                        exceptions, for to do so is to contradict the truth entirely. </para>
                    <para>Salvation is the recognition that the truth is true, and nothing else is
                        true. This you have heard before, but may not yet accept both parts of it.
                        Without the first, the second has no meaning. But without the second, is the
                        first no longer true. Truth cannot have an opposite. This can not be too
                        often said and thought about. For if what is not true is true as well as
                        what is true, then part of truth is false. And truth has lost its meaning.
                        Nothing but the truth is true, and what is false is false. </para>
                    <para>This is the simplest of distinctions, yet the most obscure. But not
                        because it is a difficult distinction to perceive. It is concealed behind a
                        vast array of choices that do not appear to be entirely your own. And thus
                        the truth appears to have some aspects that belie consistency, but do not
                        seem to be but contradictions introduced by you. </para>
                    <para>As God created you, you must remain unchangeable, with transitory states
                        by definition false. And that includes all shifts in feeling, alterations in
                        conditions of the body and the mind; in all awareness and in all response.
                        This is the all-inclusiveness which sets the truth apart from falsehood, and
                        the false kept separate from the truth, as what it is. </para>
                    <para>Is it not strange that you believe to think you made the world you see is
                        arrogance? God made it not. Of this you can be sure. What can He know of the
                        ephemeral, the sinful and the guilty, the afraid, the suffering and lonely,
                        and the mind that lives within a body that must die? You but accuse Him of
                        insanity, to think He made a world where such things seem to have reality.
                        He is not mad. Yet only madness makes a world like this. </para>
                    <para>To think that God made chaos, contradicts His Will, invented opposites to
                        truth, and suffers death to triumph over life; all this is arrogance.
                        Humility would see at once these things are not of Him. And can you see what
                        God created not? To think you can is merely to believe you can perceive what
                        God willed not to be. And what could be more arrogant than this? </para>
                    <para>Let us today be truly humble, and accept what we have made as what it is.
                        The power of decision is our own. Decide but to accept your rightful place
                        as co-creator of the universe, and all you think you made will disappear.
                        What rises to awareness then will be all that there ever was, eternally as
                        it is now. And it will take the place of self-deceptions made but to usurp
                        the altar to the Father and the Son. </para>
                    <para>Today we practice true humility, abandoning the false pretense by which
                        the ego seeks to prove it arrogant. Only the ego can be arrogant. But truth
                        is humble in acknowledging its mightiness, its changelessness and its
                        eternal wholeness, all-encompassing, God's perfect gift to His beloved Son.
                        We lay aside the arrogance which says that we are sinners, guilty and
                        afraid, ashamed of what we are; and lift our hearts in true humility instead
                        to Him Who has created us immaculate, like to Himself in power and in love. </para>
                    <para> he power of decision is our own. And we accept of Him that which we are,
                        and humbly recognize the Son of God. To recognize God's Son implies as well
                        that all self-concepts have been laid aside, and recognized as false. Their
                        arrogance has been perceived. And in humility the radiance of God's Son, his
                        gentleness, his perfect sinlessness, his Father's Love, his right to Heaven
                        and release from hell, are joyously accepted as our own. </para>
                    <para> ow do we join in glad acknowledgment that lies are false, and only truth
                        is true. We think of truth alone as we arise, and spend five minutes
                        practicing its ways, encouraging our frightened minds with this: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>The power of decision is my own. This day I
                                will accept myself as what my Father's Will created me to be.
                            </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Then will we wait in silence, giving up all self-deceptions, as we humbly
                        ask our Self that He reveal Himself to us. And He Who never left will come
                        again to our awareness, grateful to restore His home to God, as it was meant
                        to be. </para>
                    <para>In patience wait for Him throughout the day, and hourly invite Him with
                        the words with which the day began, concluding it with this same invitation
                        to your Self. God's Voice will answer, for He speaks for you and for your
                        Father. He will substitute the peace of God for all your frantic thoughts,
                        the truth of God for self-deceptions, and God's Son for your illusions of
                        yourself. </para>

                    <title>Lesson 153. In my defenselessness my safety lies. </title>
                    <para>You who feel threatened by this changing world, its twists of fortune and
                        its bitter jests, its brief relationships and all the "gifts" it merely
                        lends to take away again; attend this lesson well. The world provides no
                        safety. It is rooted in attack, and all its "gifts" of seeming safety are
                        illusory deceptions. It attacks, and then attacks again. No peace of mind is
                        possible where danger threatens thus. </para>
                    <para>The world gives rise but to defensiveness. For threat brings anger, anger
                        makes attack seem reasonable, honestly provoked, and righteous in the name
                        of self-defense. Yet is defensiveness a double threat. For it attests to
                        weakness, and sets up a system of defense that cannot work. Now are the weak
                        still further undermined, for there is treachery without and still a greater
                        treachery within. The mind is now confused, and knows not where to turn to
                        find escape from its imaginings. </para>
                    <para>It is as if a circle held it fast, wherein another circle bound it and
                        another one in that, until escape no longer can be hoped for nor obtained.
                        Attack, defense; defense, attack, become the circles of the hours and the
                        days that bind the mind in heavy bands of steel with iron overlaid,
                        returning but to start again. There seems to be no break nor ending in the
                        ever-tightening grip of the imprisonment upon the mind. </para>
                    <para>Defenses are the costliest of all the prices which the ego would exact. In
                        them lies madness in a form so grim that hope of sanity seems but to be an
                        idle dream, beyond the possible. The sense of threat the world encourages is
                        so much deeper, and so far beyond the frenzy and intensity of which you can
                        conceive, that you have no idea of all the devastation it has wrought. </para>
                    <para> You are its slave. You know not what you do, in fear of it. You do not
                        understand how much you have been made to sacrifice, who feel its iron grip
                        upon your heart. You do not realize what you have done to sabotage the holy
                        peace of God by your defensiveness. For you behold the Son of God as but a
                        victim to attack by fantasies, by dreams, and by illusions he has made; yet
                        helpless in their presence, needful only of defense by still more fantasies,
                        and dreams by which illusions of his safety comfort him. </para>
                    <para>Defenselessness is strength. It testifies to recognition of the Christ in
                        you. Perhaps you will recall the text maintains that choice is always made
                        between Christ's strength and your own weakness, seen apart from Him.
                        Defenselessness can never be attacked, because it recognizes strength so
                        great attack is folly, or a silly game a tired child might play, when he
                        becomes too sleepy to remember what he wants. </para>
                    <para>Defensiveness is weakness. It proclaims you have denied the Christ and
                        come to fear His Father's anger. What can save you now from your delusion of
                        an angry god, whose fearful image you believe you see at work in all the
                        evils of the world? What but illusions could defend you now, when it is but
                        illusions that you fight? </para>
                    <para>We will not play such childish games today. For our true purpose is to
                        save the world, and we would not exchange for foolishness the endless joy
                        our function offers us. We would not let our happiness slip by because a
                        fragment of a senseless dream happened to cross our minds, and we mistook
                        the figures in it for the Son of God; its tiny instant for eternity. </para>
                    <para>We look past dreams today, and recognize that we need no defense because
                        we are created unassailable, without all thought or wish or dream in which
                        attack has any meaning. Now we cannot fear, for we have left all fearful
                        thoughts behind. And in defenselessness we stand secure, serenely certain of
                        our safety now, sure of salvation; sure we will fulfill our chosen purpose,
                        as our ministry extends its holy blessing through the world. </para>
                    <para>Be still a moment, and in silence think how holy is your purpose, how
                        secure you rest, untouchable within its light. God's ministers have chosen
                        that the truth be with them. Who is holier than they? Who could be surer
                        that his happiness is fully guaranteed? And who could be more mightily
                        protected? What defense could possibly be needed by the ones who are among
                        the chosen ones of God, by His election and their own as well? </para>
                    <para>It is the function of God's ministers to help their brothers choose as
                        they have done. God has elected all, but few have come to realize His Will
                        is but their own. And while you fail to teach what you have learned,
                        salvation waits and darkness holds the world in grim imprisonment. Nor will
                        you learn that light has come to you, and your escape has been accomplished.
                        For you will not see the light, until you offer it to all your brothers. As
                        they take it from your hands, so will you recognize it as your own. </para>
                    <para>Salvation can be thought of as a game that happy children play. It was
                        designed by One Who loves His children, and Who would replace their fearful
                        toys with joyous games, which teach them that the game of fear is gone. His
                        game instructs in happiness because there is no loser. Everyone who plays
                        must win, and in his winning is the gain to everyone ensured. The game of
                        fear is gladly laid aside, when children come to see the benefits salvation
                        brings. </para>
                    <para>You who have played that you are lost to hope, abandoned by your Father,
                        left alone in terror in a fearful world made mad by sin and guilt; be happy
                        now. That game is over. Now a quiet time has come, in which we put away the
                        toys of guilt, and lock our quaint and childish thoughts of sin forever from
                        the pure and holy minds of Heaven's children and the Son of God. </para>
                    <para>We pause but for a moment more, to play our final, happy game upon this
                        earth. And then we go to take our rightful place where truth abides and
                        games are meaningless. So is the story ended. Let this day bring the last
                        chapter closer to the world, that everyone may learn the tale he reads of
                        terrifying destiny, defeat of all his hopes, his pitiful defense against a
                        vengeance he can not escape, is but his own deluded fantasy. God's ministers
                        have come to waken him from the dark dreams this story has evoked in his
                        confused, bewildered memory of this distorted tale. God's Son can smile at
                        last, on learning that it is not true. </para>
                    <para>Today we practice in a form we will maintain for quite a while. We will
                        begin each day by giving our attention to the daily thought as long as
                        possible. Five minutes now becomes the least we give to preparation for a
                        day in which salvation is the only goal we have. Ten would be better;
                        fifteen better still. And as distraction ceases to arise to turn us from our
                        purpose, we will find that half an hour is too short a time to spend with
                        God. Nor will we willingly give less at night, in gratitude and joy. </para>
                    <para>Each hour adds to our increasing peace, as we remember to be faithful to
                        the Will we share with God. At times, perhaps, a minute, even less, will be
                        the most that we can offer as the hour strikes. Sometimes we will forget. At
                        other times the business of the world will close on us, and we will be
                        unable to withdraw a little while, and turn our thoughts to God. </para>
                    <para>Yet when we can, we will observe our trust as ministers of God, in hourly
                        remembrance of our mission and His Love. And we will quietly sit by and wait
                        on Him and listen to His Voice, and learn what He would have us do the hour
                        that is yet to come; while thanking Him for all the gifts He gave us in the
                        one gone by. </para>
                    <para>In time, with practice, you will never cease to think of Him, and hear His
                        loving Voice guiding your footsteps into quiet ways, where you will walk in
                        true defenselessness. For you will know that Heaven goes with you. Nor would
                        you keep your mind away from Him a moment, even though your time is spent in
                        offering salvation to the world. Think you He will not make this possible,
                        for you who chose to carry out His plan for the salvation of the world and
                        yours? </para>
                    <para>Today our theme is our defenselessness. We clothe ourselves in it, as we
                        prepare to meet the day. We rise up strong in Christ, and let our weakness
                        disappear, as we remember that His strength abides in us. We will remind
                        ourselves that He remains beside us through the day, and never leaves our
                        weakness unsupported by His strength. We call upon His strength each time we
                        feel the threat of our defenses undermine our certainty of purpose. We will
                        pause a moment, as He tells us, "I am here." </para>
                    <para>Your practicing will now begin to take the earnestness of love, to help
                        you keep your mind from wandering from its intent. Be not afraid nor timid.
                        There can be no doubt that you will reach your final goal. The ministers of
                        God can never fail, because the love and strength and peace that shine from
                        them to all their brothers come from Him. These are His gifts to you.
                        Defenselessness is all you need to give Him in return. You lay aside but
                        what was never real, to look on Christ and see His sinlessness. </para>

                    <para> Let us today be neither arrogant nor falsely humble. We have gone beyond
                        such foolishness. We cannot judge ourselves, nor need we do so. These are
                        but attempts to hold decision off, and to delay commitment to our function.
                        It is not our part to judge our worth, nor can we know what role is best for
                        us; what we can do within a larger plan we cannot see in its entirety. Our
                        part is cast in Heaven, not in hell. And what we think is weakness can be
                        strength; what we believe to be our strength is often arrogance. </para>
                    <para> Whatever your appointed role may be, it was selected by the Voice for
                        God, Whose function is to speak for you as well. Seeing your strengths
                        exactly as they are, and equally aware of where they can be best applied,
                        for what, to whom and when, He chooses and accepts your part for you. He
                        does not work without your own consent. But He is not deceived in what you
                        are, and listens only to His Voice in you. </para>
                    <para> It is through His ability to hear one Voice which is His Own that you
                        become aware at last there is one Voice in you. And that one Voice appoints
                        your function, and relays it to you, giving you the strength to understand
                        it, do what it entails, and to succeed in everything you do that is related
                        to it. God has joined His Son in this, and thus His Son becomes His
                        messenger of unity with Him. </para>
                    <para> It is this joining, through the Voice for God, of Father and of Son, that
                        sets apart salvation from the world. It is this Voice which speaks of laws
                        the world does not obey; which promises salvation from all sin, with guilt
                        abolished in the mind that God created sinless. Now this mind becomes aware
                        again of Who created it, and of His lasting union with itself. So is its
                        Self the one reality in which its will and that of God are joined. </para>
                    <para> A messenger is not the one who writes the message he delivers. Nor does
                        he question the right of him who does, nor ask why he has chosen those who
                        will receive the message that he brings. It is enough that he accept it,
                        give it to the ones for whom it is intended, and fulfill his role in its
                        delivery. If he determines what the messages should be, or what their
                        purpose is, or where they should be carried, he is failing to perform his
                        proper part as bringer of the Word. </para>
                    <para> There is one major difference in the role of Heaven's messengers, which
                        sets them off from those the world appoints. The messages that they deliver
                        are intended first for them. And it is only as they can accept them for
                        themselves that they become able to bring them further, and to give them
                        everywhere that they were meant to be. Like earthly messengers, they did not
                        write the messages they bear, but they become their first receivers in the
                        truest sense, receiving to prepare themselves to give. </para>
                    <para> An earthly messenger fulfills his role by giving all his messages away.
                        The messengers of God perform their part by their acceptance of His messages
                        as for themselves, and show they understand the messages by giving them
                        away. They choose no roles that are not given them by His authority. And so
                        they gain by every message that they give away. </para>
                    <para> Would you receive the messages of God? For thus do you become His
                        messenger. You are appointed now. And yet you wait to give the messages you
                        have received. And so you do not know that they are yours, and do not
                        recognize them. No one can receive and understand he has received until he
                        gives. For in the giving is his own acceptance of what he received. </para>
                    <para> You who are now the messenger of God, receive His messages. For that is
                        part of your appointed role. God has not failed to offer what you need, nor
                        has it been left unaccepted. Yet another part of your appointed task is yet
                        to be accomplished. He Who has received for you the messages of God would
                        have them be received by you as well. For thus do you identify with Him and
                        claim your own. </para>
                    <para> It is this joining that we undertake to recognize today. We will not seek
                        to keep our minds apart from Him Who speaks for us, for it is but our voice
                        we hear as we attend Him. He alone can speak to us and for us, joining in
                        one Voice the getting and the giving of God's Word; the giving and receiving
                        of His Will. </para>
                    <para> We practice giving Him what He would have, that we may recognize His
                        gifts to us. He needs our voice that He may speak through us. He needs our
                        hands to hold His messages, and carry them to those whom He appoints. He
                        needs our feet to bring us where He wills, that those who wait in misery may
                        be at last delivered. And He needs our will united with His Own, that we may
                        be the true receivers of the gifts He gives. </para>
                    <para> Let us but learn this lesson for today: We will not recognize what we
                        receive until we give it. You have heard this said a hundred ways, a hundred
                        times, and yet belief is lacking still. But this is sure; until belief is
                        given it, you will receive a thousand miracles and then receive a thousand
                        more, but will not know that God Himself has left no gift beyond what you
                        already have; nor has denied the tiniest of blessings to His Son. What can
                        this mean to you, until you have identified with Him and with His Own? </para>
                    <para> Our lesson for today is stated thus: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>I am among the ministers of God, and I am                                grateful that </para>
                        <para>I have the means by which to recognize that I                                am free. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para> The world recedes as we light up our minds, and realize these holy words
                        are true. They are the message sent to us today from our Creator. Now we
                        demonstrate how they have changed our minds about ourselves, and what our
                        function is. For as we prove that we accept no will we do not share, our
                        many gifts from our Creator will spring to our sight and leap into our
                        hands, and we will recognize what we received. </para>

                    <title>Lesson 155. I will step back and let Him lead the way.</title>
                    <para> There is a way of living in the world that is not here, although it seems
                        to be. You do not change appearance, though you smile more frequently. Your
                        forehead is serene; your eyes are quiet. And the ones who walk the world as
                        you do recognize their own. Yet those who have not yet perceived the way
                        will recognize you also, and believe that you are like them, as you were
                        before. </para>
                    <para> The world is an illusion. Those who choose to come to it are seeking for
                        a place where they can be illusions, and avoid their own reality. Yet when
                        they find their own reality is even here, then they step back and let it
                        lead the way. What other choice is really theirs to make? To let illusions
                        walk ahead of truth is madness. But to let illusion sink behind the truth
                        and let the truth stand forth as what it is, is merely sanity. </para>
                    <para> This is the simple choice we make today. The mad illusion will remain
                        awhile in evidence, for those to look upon who chose to come, and have not
                        yet rejoiced to find they were mistaken in their choice. They cannot learn
                        directly from the truth, because they have denied that it is so. And so they
                        need a Teacher Who perceives their madness, but Who still can look beyond
                        illusion to the simple truth in them. </para>
                    <para> If truth demanded they give up the world, it would appear to them as if
                        it asked the sacrifice of something that is real. Many have chosen to
                        renounce the world while still believing its reality. And they have suffered
                        from a sense of loss, and have not been released accordingly. Others have
                        chosen nothing but the world, and they have suffered from a sense of loss
                        still deeper, which they did not understand. </para>
                    <para> Between these paths there is another road that leads away from loss of
                        every kind, for sacrifice and deprivation both are quickly left behind. This
                        is the way appointed for you now. You walk this path as others walk, nor do
                        you seem to be distinct from them, although you are indeed. Thus can you
                        serve them while you serve yourself, and set their footsteps on the way that
                        God has opened up to you, and them through you. </para>
                    <para> Illusion still appears to cling to you, that you may reach them. Yet it
                        has stepped back. And it is not illusion that they hear you speak of, nor
                        illusion that you bring their eyes to look on and their minds to grasp. Nor
                        can the truth, which walks ahead of you, speak to them through illusions,
                        for the road leads past illusion now, while on the way you call to them,
                        that they may follow you. </para>
                    <para> All roads will lead to this one in the end. For sacrifice and deprivation
                        are paths that lead nowhere, choices for defeat, and aims that will remain
                        impossible. All this steps back as truth comes forth in you, to lead your
                        brothers from the ways of death, and set them on the way to happiness. Their
                        suffering is but illusion. Yet they need a guide to lead them out of it, for
                        they mistake illusion for the truth. </para>
                    <para> Such is salvation's call, and nothing more. It asks that you accept the
                        truth, and let it go before you, lighting up the path of ransom from
                        illusion. It is not a ransom with a price. There is no cost, but only gain.
                        Illusion can but seem to hold in chains the holy Son of God. It is but from
                        illusions he is saved. As they step back, he finds himself again. </para>
                    <para> Walk safely now, yet carefully, because this path is new to you. And you
                        may find that you are tempted still to walk ahead of truth, and let
                        illusions be your guide. Your holy brothers have been given you, to follow
                        in your footsteps as you walk with certainty of purpose to the truth. It
                        goes before you now, that they may see something with which they can
                        identify; something they understand to lead the way. </para>
                    <para> Yet at the journey's ending there will be no gap, no distance between
                        truth and you. And all illusions walking in the way you travelled will be
                        gone from you as well, with nothing left to keep the truth apart from God's
                        completion, holy as Himself. Step back in faith and let truth lead the way.
                        You know not where you go. But One Who knows goes with you. Let Him lead you
                        with the rest. </para>
                    <para> When dreams are over, time has closed the door on all the things that
                        pass and miracles are purposeless, the holy Son of God will make no
                        journeys. There will be no wish to be illusion rather than the truth. And we
                        step forth toward this, as we progress along the way that truth points out
                        to us. This is our final journey, which we make for everyone. We must not
                        lose our way. For as truth goes before us, so it goes before our brothers
                        who will follow us. </para>
                    <para> We walk to God. Pause and reflect on this. Could any way be holier, or
                        more deserving of your effort, of your love and of your full intent? What
                        way could give you more than everything, or offer less and still content the
                        holy Son of God? We walk to God. The truth that walks before us now is one
                        with Him, and leads us to where He has always been. What way but this could
                        be a path that you would choose instead? </para>
                    <para> Your feet are safely set upon the road that leads the world to God. Look
                        not to ways that seem to lead you elsewhere. Dreams are not a worthy guide
                        for you who are God's Son. Forget not He has placed His Hand in yours, and
                        given you your brothers in His trust that you are worthy of His trust in
                        you. He cannot be deceived. His trust has made your pathway certain and your
                        goal secure. You will not fail your brothers nor your Self. </para>
                    <para> And now He asks but that you think of Him a while each day, that He may
                        speak to you and tell you of His Love, reminding you how great His trust;
                        how limitless His Love. In your Name and His Own, which are the same, we
                        practice gladly with this thought today: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>I will step back and let Him lead the                                way,</para>
                        <para>For I would walk along the road to Him.                            </para>

                    <para> Today's idea but states the simple truth that makes the thought of sin
                        impossible. It promises there is no cause for guilt, and being causeless it
                        does not exist. It follows surely from the basic thought so often mentioned
                        in the text; ideas leave not their source. If this be true, how can you be
                        apart from God? How could you walk the world alone and separate from your
                        Source? </para>
                    <para> We are not inconsistent in the thoughts that we present in our

                        contradict itself, nor be in parts uncertain and in others sure. You cannot
                        walk the world apart from God, because you could not be without Him. He is
                        what your life is. Where you are He is. There is one life. That life you
                        share with Him. Nothing can be apart from Him and live. </para>
                    <para> Yet where He is, there must be holiness as well as life. No attribute of
                        His remains unshared by everything that lives. What lives is holy as
                        Himself, because what shares His life is part of Holiness, and could no more
                        be sinful than the sun could choose to be of ice; the sea elect to be apart
                        from water, or the grass to grow with roots suspended in the air. </para>
                    <para> There is a light in you which cannot die; whose presence is so holy that
                        the world is sanctified because of you. All things that live bring gifts to
                        you, and offer them in gratitude and gladness at your feet. The scent of
                        flowers is their gift to you. The waves bow down before you, and the trees
                        extend their arms to shield you from the heat, and lay their leaves before
                        you on the ground that you may walk in softness, while the wind sinks to a
                        whisper round your holy head. </para>
                    <para> The light in you is what the universe longs to behold. All living things
                        are still before you, for they recognize Who walks with you. The light you
                        carry is their own. And thus they see in you their holiness, saluting you as
                        savior and as God. Accept their reverence, for it is due to Holiness Itself,
                        which walks with you, transforming in Its gentle light all things unto Its
                        likeness and Its purity. </para>
                    <para> This is the way salvation works. As you step back, the light in you steps
                        forward and encompasses the world. It heralds not the end of sin in
                        punishment and death. In lightness and in laughter is sin gone, because its
                        quaint absurdity is seen. It is a foolish thought, a silly dream, not
                        frightening, ridiculous perhaps, but who would waste an instant in approach
                        to God Himself for such a senseless whim? </para>
                    <para> Yet you have wasted many, many years on just this foolish thought. The
                        past is gone, with all its fantasies. They keep you bound no longer. The
                        approach to God is near. And in the little interval of doubt that still
                        remains, you may perhaps lose sight of your Companion, and mistake Him for
                        the senseless, ancient dream that now is past. </para>
                    <para> "Who walks with me?" This question should be asked a thousand times a
                        day, till certainty has ended doubting and established peace. Today let
                        doubting cease. God speaks for you in answering your question with these
                        words: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>I walk with God in perfect holiness. I light
                                the world, I light my mind and all the minds which God created one
                                with me. </para>

                    <title>Lesson 157. Into His Presence would I enter now. </title>
                    <para> This is a day of silence and of trust. It is a special time of promise in
                        your calendar of days. It is a time Heaven has set apart to shine upon, and
                        cast a timeless light upon this day, when echoes of eternity are heard. This
                        day is holy, for it ushers in a new experience; a different kind of feeling
                        and awareness. You have spent long days and nights in celebrating death.
                        Today you learn to feel the joy of life. </para>
                    <para> This is another crucial turning point in the curriculum. We add a new
                        dimension now; a fresh experience that sheds a light on all that we have
                        learned already, and prepares us for what we have yet to learn. It brings us
                        to the door where learning ceases, and we catch a glimpse of what lies past
                        the highest reaches it can possibly attain. It leaves us here an instant,
                        and we go beyond it, sure of our direction and our only goal. </para>
                    <para> Today it will be given you to feel a touch of Heaven, though you will
                        return to paths of learning. Yet you have come far enough along the way to
                        alter time sufficiently to rise above its laws, and walk into eternity a
                        while. This you will learn to do increasingly, as every lesson, faithfully
                        rehearsed, brings you more swiftly to this holy place and leaves you, for a
                        moment, to your Self. </para>
                    <para> He will direct your practicing today, for what you ask for now is what He
                        wills. And having joined your will with His this day, what you are asking
                        must be given you. Nothing is needed but today's idea to light your mind,
                        and let it rest in still anticipation and in quiet joy, wherein you quickly
                        leave the world behind. </para>
                    <para> From this day forth, your ministry takes on a genuine devotion, and a
                        glow that travels from your fingertips to those you touch, and blesses those
                        you look upon. A vision reaches everyone you meet, and everyone you think
                        of, or who thinks of you. For your experience today will so transform your
                        mind that it becomes the touchstone for the holy Thoughts of God. </para>
                    <para> Your body will be sanctified today, its only purpose being now to bring
                        the vision of what you experience this day to light the world. We cannot
                        give experience like this directly. Yet it leaves a vision in our eyes which
                        we can offer everyone, that he may come the sooner to the same experience in
                        which the world is quietly forgot, and Heaven is remembered for a while. </para>
                    <para> As this experience increases and all goals but this become of little
                        worth, the world to which you will return becomes a little closer to the end
                        of time; a little more like Heaven in its ways; a little nearer its
                        deliverance. And you who bring it light will come to see the light more
                        sure; the vision more distinct. The time will come when you will not return
                        in the same form in which you now appear, for you will have no need of it.
                        Yet now it has a purpose, and will serve it well. </para>
                    <para> Today we will embark upon a course you have not dreamed of. But the Holy
                        One, the Giver of the happy dreams of life, Translator of perception into
                        truth, the holy Guide to Heaven given you, has dreamed for you this journey
                        which you make and start today, with the experience this day holds out to
                        you to be your own. </para>
                    <para> Into Christ's Presence will we enter now, serenely unaware of everything
                        except His shining face and perfect Love. The vision of His face will stay
                        with you, but there will be an instant which transcends all vision, even
                        this, the holiest. This you will never teach, for you attained it not
                        through learning. Yet the vision speaks of your rememberance of what you
                        knew that instant, and will surely know again. </para>

                <section xml:id="L158">
                    <title>Lesson 158. Today I learn to give as I receive. </title>
                    <para> What has been given you? The knowledge that you are a mind, in Mind and
                        purely mind, sinless forever, wholly unafraid, because you were created out
                        of love. Nor have you left your Source, remaining as you were created. This
                        was given you as knowledge which you cannot lose. It was given as well to
                        every living thing, for by that knowledge only does it live. </para>
                    <para> You have received all this. No one who walks the world but has received
                        it. It is not this knowledge which you give, for that is what creation gave.
                        All this cannot be learned. What, then, are you to learn to give today? Our
                        lesson yesterday evoked a theme found early in the text. Experience cannot
                        be shared directly, in the way that vision can. The revelation that the
                        Father and the Son are one will come in time to every mind. Yet is that time
                        determined by the mind itself, not taught. </para>
                    <para> The time is set already. It appears to be quite arbitrary. Yet there is
                        no step along the road that anyone takes but by chance. It has already been
                        taken by him, although he has not yet embarked on it. For time but seems to
                        go in one direction. We but undertake a journey that is over. Yet it seems
                        to have a future still unknown to us. </para>
                    <para> Time is a trick, a sleight of hand, a vast illusion in which figures come
                        and go as if by magic. Yet there is a plan behind appearances that does not
                        change. The script is written. When experience will come to end your
                        doubting has been set. For we but see the journey from the point at which it
                        ended, looking back on it, imagining we make it once again; reviewing
                        mentally what has gone by. </para>
                    <para> A teacher does not give experience, because he did not learn it. It
                        revealed itself to him at its appointed time. But vision is his gift. This
                        he can give directly, for Christ's knowledge is not lost, because He has a
                        vision He can give to anyone who asks. The Father's Will and His are joined
                        in knowledge. Yet there is a vision which the Holy Spirit sees because the
                        Mind of Christ beholds it too. </para>
                    <para> Here is the joining of the world of doubt and shadows made with the
                        intangible. Here is a quiet place within the world made holy by forgiveness
                        and by love. Here are all contradictions reconciled, for here the journey
                        ends. Experience–unlearned, untaught, unseen–is merely there. This is beyond
                        our goal, for it transcends what needs to be accomplished. Our concern is
                        with Christ's vision. This we can attain. </para>
                    <para> Christ's vision has one law. It does not look upon a body, and mistake it
                        for the Son whom God created. It beholds a light beyond the body; an idea
                        beyond what can be touched, a purity undimmed by errors, pitiful mistakes,
                        and fearful thoughts of guilt from dreams of sin. It sees no separation. And
                        it looks on everyone, on every circumstance, all happenings and all events,
                        without the slightest fading of the light it sees. </para>
                    <para> This can be taught; and must be taught by all who would achieve it. It
                        requires but the recognition that the world can not give anything that
                        faintly can compare with this in value; nor set up a goal that does not
                        merely disappear when this has been perceived. And this you give today: See
                        no one as a body. Greet him as the Son of God he is, acknowledging that he
                        is one with you in holiness. </para>
                    <para> Thus are his sins forgiven him, for Christ has vision that has power to
                        overlook them all. In His forgiveness are they gone. Unseen by One they
                        merely disappear, because a vision of the holiness that lies beyond them
                        comes to take their place. It matters not what form they took, nor how
                        enormous they appeared to be, nor who seemed to be hurt by them. They are no
                        more. And all effects they seemed to have are gone with them, undone and
                        never to be done. </para>
                    <para> Thus do you learn to give as you receive. And thus Christ's vision looks
                        on you as well. This lesson is not difficult to learn, if you remember in
                        your brother you but see yourself. If he be lost in sin, so must you be; if
                        you see light in him, your sins have been forgiven by yourself. Each brother
                        whom you meet today provides another chance to let Christ's vision shine on
                        you, and offer you the peace of God. </para>
                    <para> It matters not when revelation comes, for that is not of time. Yet time
                        has still one gift to give, in which true knowledge is reflected in a way so
                        accurate its image shares its unseen holiness; its likeness shines with its
                        immortal love. We practice seeing with the eyes of Christ today. And by the
                        holy gifts we give, Christ's vision looks upon ourselves as well. </para>

                    <title>Lesson 159. I give the miracles I have received.</title>
                    <para> No one can give what he has not received. To give a thing requires first
                        you have it in your own possession. Here the laws of Heaven and the world
                        agree. But here they also separate. The world believes that to possess a
                        thing, it must be kept. Salvation teaches otherwise. To give is how to
                        recognize you have received. It is the proof that what you have is yours. </para>
                    <para> You understand that you are healed when you give healing. You accept
                        forgiveness as accomplished in yourself when you forgive. You recognize your
                        brother as yourself, and thus do you perceive that you are whole. There is
                        no miracle you cannot give, for all are given you. Receive them now by
                        opening the storehouse of your mind where they are laid, and giving them
                        away. </para>
                    <para> Christ's vision is a miracle. It comes from far beyond itself, for it
                        reflects eternal love and the rebirth of love which never dies, but has been
                        kept obscure. Christ's vision pictures Heaven, for it sees a world so like
                        to Heaven that what God created perfect can be mirrored there. The darkened
                        glass the world presents can show but twisted images in broken parts. The
                        real world pictures Heaven's innocence. </para>
                    <para> Christ's vision is the miracle in which all miracles are born. It is
                        their source, remaining with each miracle you give, and yet remaining yours.
                        It is the bond by which the giver and receiver are united in extension here
                        on earth, as they are one in Heaven. Christ beholds no sin in anyone. And in
                        His sight the sinless are as one. Their holiness was given by His Father and
                        Himself. </para>
                    <para> Christ's vision is the bridge between the worlds. And in its power can
                        you safely trust to carry you from this world into one made holy by
                        forgiveness. Things which seem quite solid here are merely shadows there;
                        transparent, faintly seen, at times forgot, and never able to obscure the
                        light that shines beyond them. Holiness has been restored to vision, and the
                        blind can see. </para>
                    <para> This is the Holy Spirit's single gift; the treasure house to which you
                        can appeal with perfect certainty for all the things that can contribute to
                        your happiness. All are laid here already. All can be received but for the
                        asking. Here the door is never locked, and no one is denied his least
                        request or his most urgent need. There is no sickness not already healed, no
                        lack unsatisfied, no need unmet within this golden treasury of Christ. </para>
                    <para> Here does the world remember what was lost when it was made. For here it
                        is repaired, made new again, but in a different light. What was to be the
                        home of sin becomes the center of redemption and the hearth of mercy, where
                        the suffering are healed and welcome. No one will be turned away from this
                        new home, where his salvation waits. No one is stranger to him. No one asks
                        for anything of him except the gift of his acceptance of his welcoming. </para>
                    <para> Christ's vision is the holy ground in which the lilies of forgiveness set
                        their roots. This is their home. They can be brought from here back to the
                        world, but they can never grow in its unnourishing and shallow soil. They
                        need the light and warmth and kindly care Christ's charity provides. They
                        need the love with which He looks on them. And they become His messengers,
                        who give as they received. </para>
                    <para> Take from His storehouse, that its treasures may increase. His lilies do
                        not leave their home when they are carried back into the world. Their roots
                        remain. They do not leave their source, but carry its beneficence with them,
                        and turn the world into a garden like the one they came from, and to which
                        they go again with added fragrance. Now are they twice blessed. The messages
                        they brought from Christ have been delivered, and returned to them. And they
                        return them gladly unto Him. </para>
                    <para> Behold the store of miracles set out for you to give. Are you not worth
                        the gift, when God appointed it be given you? Judge not God's Son, but
                        follow in the way He has established. Christ has dreamed the dream of a
                        forgiven world. It is His gift, whereby a sweet transition can be made from
                        death to life; from hopelessness to hope. Let us an instant dream with Him.
                        His dream awakens us to truth. His vision gives the means for a return to
                        our unlost and everlasting sanctity in God. </para>

                    <title>Lesson 160. I am at home. Fear is the stranger here. </title>
                    <para> Fear is a stranger to the ways of love. Identify with fear, and you will
                        be a stranger to yourself. And thus you are unknown to you. What is your
                        Self remains an alien to the part of you which thinks that it is real, but
                        different from yourself. Who could be sane in such a circumstance? Who but a
                        madman could believe he is what he is not, and judge against himself? </para>
                    <para> There is a stranger in our midst, who comes from an idea so foreign to
                        the truth he speaks a different language, looks upon a world truth does not
                        know, and understands what truth regards as senseless. Stranger yet, he does
                        not recognize to whom he comes, and yet maintains his home belongs to him,
                        while he is alien now who is at home. And yet, how easy it would be to say,
                        "This is my home. Here I belong, and will not leave because a madman says I
                        must." </para>
                    <para> What reason is there for not saying this? What could the reason be except
                        that you had asked this stranger in to take your place, and let you be a
                        stranger to yourself? No one would let himself be dispossessed so
                        needlessly, unless he thought there were another home more suited to his
                        tastes. </para>
                    <para> Who is the stranger? Is it fear or you who are unsuited to the home which
                        God provided for His Son? Is fear His Own, created in His likeness? Is it
                        fear that love completes, and is completed by? There is no home can shelter
                        love and fear. They cannot coexist. If you are real, then fear must be
                        illusion. And if fear is real, then you do not exist at all. </para>
                    <para> How simply, then, the question is resolved. Who fears has but denied
                        himself and said, "I am the stranger here. And so I leave my home to one
                        more like me than myself, and give him all I thought belonged to me." Now is
                        he exiled of necessity, not knowing who he is, uncertain of all things but
                        this; that he is not himself, and that his home has been denied to him. </para>
                    <para> What does he search for now? What can he find? A stranger to himself can
                        find no home wherever he may look, for he has made return impossible. His
                        way is lost, except a miracle will search him out and show him that he is no
                        stranger now. The miracle will come. For in his home his Self remains. It
                        asked no stranger in, and took no alien thought to be Itself. And It will
                        call Its Own unto Itself in recognition of what is Its Own. </para>
                    <para> Who is the stranger? Is he not the one your Self calls not? You are
                        unable now to recognize this stranger in your midst, for you have given him
                        your rightful place. Yet is your Self as certain of Its Own as God is of His
                        Son. He cannot be confused about creation. He is sure of what belongs to
                        Him. No stranger can be interposed between His knowledge and His Son's
                        reality. He does not know of strangers. He is certain of His Son. </para>
                    <para> God's certainty suffices. Who He knows to be His Son belongs where He has
                        set His Son forever. He has answered you who ask, "Who is the stranger?"
                        Hear His Voice assure you, quietly and sure, that you are not a stranger to
                        your Father, nor is your Creator stranger made to you. Whom God has joined
                        remain forever one, at home in Him, no stranger to Himself. </para>
                    <para> Today we offer thanks that Christ has come to search the world for what
                        belongs to Him. His vision sees no strangers, but beholds His Own and
                        joyously unites with them. They see Him as a stranger, for they do not
                        recognize themselves. Yet as they give Him welcome, they remember. And He
                        leads them gently home again, where they belong. </para>
                    <para> Not one does Christ forget. Not one He fails to give you to remember,
                        that your home may be complete and perfect as it was established. He has not
                        forgotten you. But you will not remember Him until you look on all as He
                        does. Who denies his brother is denying Him, and thus refusing to accept the
                        gift of sight by which his Self is clearly recognized, his home remembered
                        and salvation come. </para>

                    <para> Today we practice differently, and take a stand against our anger, that
                        our fears may disappear and offer room to love. Here is salvation in the
                        simple words in which we practice with today's idea. Here is the answer to
                        temptation which can never fail to welcome in the Christ where fear and
                        anger had prevailed before. Here is Atonement made complete, the world
                        passed safely by and Heaven now restored. Here is the answer of the Voice
                        for God. </para>
                    <para> Complete abstraction is the natural condition of the mind. But part of it
                        is now unnatural. It does not look on everything as one. It sees instead but
                        fragments of the whole, for only thus could it invent the partial world you
                        see. The purpose of all seeing is to show you what you wish to see. All
                        hearing but brings to your mind the sounds it wants to hear. </para>
                    <para> Thus were specifics made. And now it is specifics we must use in
                        practicing. We give them to the Holy Spirit, that He may employ them for a
                        purpose which is different from the one we gave to them. Yet He can use but
                        what we made, to teach us from a different point of view, so we can see a
                        different use in everything. </para>
                    <para> One brother is all brothers. Every mind contains all minds, for every
                        mind is one. Such is the truth. Yet do these thoughts make clear the meaning
                        of creation? Do these words bring perfect clarity with them to you? What can
                        they seem to be but empty sounds; pretty, perhaps, correct in sentiment, yet
                        fundamentally not understood nor understandable. The mind that taught itself
                        to think specifically can no longer grasp abstraction in the sense that it
                        is all-encompassing. We need to see a little, that we learn a lot. </para>
                    <para> It seems to be the body that we feel limits our freedom, makes us suffer,
                        and at last puts out our life. Yet bodies are but symbols for a concrete
                        form of fear. Fear without symbols calls for no response, for symbols can
                        stand for the meaningless. Love needs no symbols, being true. But fear
                        attaches to specifics, being false. </para>
                    <para> Bodies attack, but minds do not. This thought is surely reminiscent of
                        our text, where it is often emphasized. This is the reason bodies easily
                        become fear's symbols. You have many times been urged to look beyond the
                        body, for its sight presents the symbol of love's "enemy" Christ's vision
                        does not see. The body is the target for attack, for no one thinks he hates
                        a mind. Yet what but mind directs the body to attack? What else could be the
                        seat of fear except what thinks of fear? </para>
                    <para> Hate is specific. There must be a thing to be attacked. An enemy must be
                        perceived in such a form he can be touched and seen and heard, and
                        ultimately killed. When hatred rests upon a thing, it calls for death as
                        surely as God's Voice proclaims there is no death. Fear is insatiable,
                        consuming everything its eyes behold, seeing itself in everything, compelled
                        to turn upon itself and to destroy. </para>
                    <para> Who sees a brother as a body sees him as fear's symbol. And he will
                        attack, because what he beholds is his own fear external to himself, poised
                        to attack, and howling to unite with him again. Mistake not the intensity of
                        rage projected fear must spawn. It shrieks in wrath, and claws the air in
                        frantic hope it can reach to its maker and devour him. </para>
                    <para> This do the body's eyes behold in one whom Heaven cherishes, the angels
                        love and God created perfect. This is his reality. And in Christ's vision is
                        his loveliness reflected in a form so holy and so beautiful that you could
                        scarce refrain from kneeling at his feet. Yet you will take his hand
                        instead, for you are like him in the sight that sees him thus. Attack on him
                        is enemy to you, for you will not perceive that in his hands is your
                        salvation. Ask him but for this, and he will give it to you. Ask him not to
                        symbolize your fear. Would you request that love destroy itself? Or would
                        you have it be revealed to you and set you free? </para>
                    <para> Today we practice in a form we have attempted earlier. Your readiness is
                        closer now, and you will come today nearer Christ's vision. If you are
                        intent on reaching it, you will succeed today. And once you have succeeded,
                        you will not be willing to accept the witnesses your body's eyes call forth.
                        What you will see will sing to you of ancient melodies you will remember.
                        You are not forgot in Heaven. Would you not remember it? </para>
                    <para> Select one brother, symbol of the rest, and ask salvation of him. See him
                        first as clearly as you can, in that same form to which you are accustomed.
                        See his face, his hands and feet, his clothing. Watch him smile, and see
                        familiar gestures which he makes so frequently. Then think of this: What you
                        are seeing now conceals from you the sight of one who can forgive you all
                        your sins; whose sacred hands can take away the nails which pierce your own,
                        and lift the crown of thorns which you have placed upon your bleeding head.
                        Ask this of him, that he may set you free: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>Give me your blessing, holy Son of God. I
                                would behold you with the eyes of Christ, and see my perfect
                                sinlessness in you. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para> And He will answer Whom you called upon. For He will hear the Voice for
                        God in you, and answer in your own. Behold him now, whom you have seen as
                        merely flesh and bone, and recognize that Christ has come to you. Today's
                        idea is your safe escape from anger and from fear. Be sure you use it
                        instantly, should you be tempted to attack a brother and perceive in him the
                        symbol of your fear. And you will see him suddenly transformed from enemy to
                        savior; from the devil into Christ. </para>

                    <para> This single thought, held firmly in the mind, would save the world. From
                        time to time we will repeat it, as we reach another stage in learning. It
                        will mean far more to you as you advance. These words are sacred, for they
                        are the words God gave in answer to the world you made. By them it
                        disappears, and all things seen within its misty clouds and vaporous
                        illusions vanish as these words are spoken. For they come from God. </para>
                    <para> Here is the Word by which the Son became his Father's happiness, His Love
                        and His completion. Here creation is proclaimed, and honored as it is. There
                        is no dream these words will not dispel; no thought of sin and no illusion
                        which the dream contains that will not fade away before their might. They
                        are the trumpet of awakening that sounds around the world. The dead awake in
                        answer to its call. And those who live and hear this sound will never look
                        on death. </para>
                    <para> Holy indeed is he who makes these words his own; arising with them in his
                        mind, recalling them throughout the day, at night bringing them with him as
                        he goes to sleep. His dreams are happy and his rest secure, his safety
                        certain and his body healed, because he sleeps and wakens with the truth
                        before him always. He will save the world, because he gives the world what
                        he receives each time he practices the words of truth. </para>
                    <para> Today we practice simply. For the words we use are mighty, and they need
                        no thoughts beyond themselves to change the mind of him who uses them. So
                        wholly is it changed that it is now the treasury in which God places all His
                        gifts and all His Love, to be distributed to all the world, increased in
                        giving; kept complete because its sharing is unlimited. And thus you learn
                        to think with God. Christ's vision has restored your sight by salvaging your
                        mind. </para>
                    <para> We honor you today. Yours is the right to perfect holiness you now
                        accept. With this acceptance is salvation brought to everyone, for who could
                        cherish sin when holiness like this has blessed the world? Who could despair
                        when perfect joy is yours, available to all as remedy for grief and misery,
                        all sense of loss, and for complete escape from sin and guilt? </para>
                    <para> And who would not be brother to you now; you, his redeemer and his
                        savior. Who could fail to welcome you into his heart with loving invitation,
                        eager to unite with one like him in holiness? You are as God created you.
                        These words dispel the night, and darkness is no more. The light is come
                        today to bless the world. For you have recognized the Son of God, and in
                        that recognition is the world's. </para>

                    <title>Lesson 163. There is no death. The Son of God is free. </title>
                    <para> Death is a thought that takes on many forms, often unrecognized. It may
                        appear as sadness, fear, anxiety or doubt; as anger, faithlessness and lack
                        of trust; concern for bodies, envy, and all forms in which the wish to be as
                        you are not may come to tempt you. All such thoughts are but reflections of
                        the worshipping of death as savior and as giver of release. </para>
                    <para> Embodiment of fear, the host of sin, god of the guilty and the lord of
                        all illusions and deceptions, does the thought of death seem mighty. For it
                        seems to hold all living things within its withered hand; all hopes and
                        wishes in its blighting grasp; all goals perceived but in its sightless
                        eyes. The frail, the helpless and the sick bow down before its image,
                        thinking it alone is real, inevitable, worthy of their trust. For it alone
                        will surely come. </para>
                    <para> All things but death are seen to be unsure, too quickly lost however hard
                        to gain, uncertain in their outcome, apt to fail the hopes they once
                        engendered, and to leave the taste of dust and ashes in their wake, in place
                        of aspirations and of dreams. But death is counted on. For it will come with
                        certain footsteps when the time has come for its arrival. It will never fail
                        to take all life as hostage to itself. </para>
                    <para> Would you bow down to idols such as this? Here is the strength and might
                        of God Himself perceived within an idol made of dust. Here is the opposite
                        of God proclaimed as lord of all creation, stronger than God's Will for
                        life, the endlessness of love and Heaven's perfect, changeless constancy.
                        Here is the Will of Father and of Son defeated finally, and laid to rest
                        beneath the headstone death has placed upon the body of the holy Son of God. </para>
                    <para> Unholy in defeat, he has become what death would have him be. His
                        epitaph, which death itself has written, gives no name to him, for he has
                        passed to dust. It says but this: "Here lies a witness God is dead." And
                        this it writes again and still again, while all the while its worshippers
                        agree, and kneeling down with foreheads to the ground, they whisper
                        fearfully that it is so. </para>
                    <para> It is impossible to worship death in any form, and still select a few you
                        would not cherish and would yet avoid, while still believing in the rest.
                        For death is total. Either all things die, or else they live and cannot die.
                        No compromise is possible. For here again we see an obvious position, which
                        we must accept if we be sane; what contradicts one thought entirely can not
                        be true, unless its opposite is proven false. </para>
                    <para> The idea of the death of God is so preposterous that even the insane have
                        difficulty in believing it. For it implies that God was once alive and
                        somehow perished; killed, apparently, by those who did not want Him to
                        survive. Their stronger will could triumph over His, and so eternal life
                        gave way to death. And with the Father died the Son as well. </para>
                    <para> Death's worshippers may be afraid. And yet, can thoughts like these be
                        fearful? If they saw that it is only this which they believe, they would be
                        instantly released. And you will show them this today. There is no death,
                        and we renounce it now in every form, for their salvation and our own as
                        well. God made not death. Whatever form it takes must therefore be illusion.
                        This the stand we take today. And it is given us to look past death, and see
                        the life beyond. </para>
                    <para> Our Father, bless our eyes today. We are Your
                            messengers, and we would look upon the glorious reflection of Your Love
                            which shines in everything. We live and move in You alone. We are not
                            separate from Your eternal life. There is no death, for death is not
                            Your Will. And we abide where You have placed us, in the life we share
                            with You and with all living things, to be like You and part of You
                            forever. We accept Your Thoughts as ours, and our will is one with Yours
                            eternally. Amen. </para>

                    <title>Lesson 164. Now are we one with Him Who is our Source. </title>
                    <para> What time but now can truth be recognized? The present is the only time
                        there is. And so today, this instant, now, we come to look upon what is
                        forever there; not in our sight, but in the eyes of Christ. He looks past
                        time, and sees eternity as represented there. He hears the sounds the
                        senseless, busy world engenders, yet He hears them faintly. For beyond them
                        all He hears the song of Heaven, and the Voice for God more clear, more
                        meaningful, more near. </para>
                    <para> The world fades easily away before His sight. Its sounds grow dim. A
                        melody from far beyond the world increasingly is more and more distinct; an
                        ancient call to which He gives an ancient answer. You will recognize them
                        both, for they are but your answer to your Father's Call to you. Christ
                        answers for you, echoing your Self, using your voice to give His glad
                        consent; accepting your deliverance for you. </para>
                    <para> How holy is your practicing today, as Christ gives you His sight and
                        hears for you, and answers in your name the Call He hears! How quiet is the
                        time you give to spend with Him, beyond the world. How easily are all your
                        seeming sins forgot, and all your sorrows unremembered. On this day is grief
                        laid by, for sights and sounds that come from nearer than the world are
                        clear to you who will today accept the gifts He gives. </para>
                    <para> There is a silence into which the world can not intrude. There is an
                        ancient peace you carry in your heart and have not lost. There is a sense of
                        holiness in you the thought of sin has never touched. All this today you
                        will remember. Faithfulness in practicing today will bring rewards so great
                        and so completely different from all things you sought before, that you will
                        know that here your treasure is, and here your rest. </para>
                    <para> This is the day when vain imaginings part like a curtain, to reveal what
                        lies beyond them. Now is what is really there made visible, while all the
                        shadows which appeared to hide it merely sink away. Now is the balance
                        righted, and the scale of judgment left to Him Who judges true. And in His
                        judgment will a world unfold in perfect innocence before your eyes. Now will
                        you see it with the eyes of Christ. Now is its transformation clear to you. </para>
                    <para> Brother, this day is sacred to the world. Your vision, given you from far
                        beyond all things within the world, looks back on them in a new light. And
                        what you see becomes the healing and salvation of the world. The valuable
                        and valueless are both perceived and recognized for what they are. And what
                        is worthy of your love receives your love, while nothing to be feared
                        remains. </para>
                    <para> We will not judge today. We will receive but what is given us from
                        judgment made beyond the world. Our practicing today becomes our gift of
                        thankfulness for our release from blindness and from misery. All that we see
                        will but increase our joy, because its holiness reflects our own. We stand
                        forgiven in the sight of Christ, with all the world forgiven in our own. We
                        bless the world, as we behold it in the light in which our Savior looks on
                        us, and offer it the freedom given us through His forgiving vision, not our
                        own. </para>
                    <para> Open the curtain in your practicing by merely letting go all things you
                        think you want. Your trifling treasures put away, and leave a clean and open
                        space within your mind where Christ can come, and offer you the treasure of
                        salvation. He has need of your most holy mind to save the world. Is not this
                        purpose worthy to be yours? Is not Christ's vision worthy to be sought above
                        the world's unsatisfying goals? </para>
                    <para> Let not today slip by without the gifts it holds for you receiving your
                        consent and your acceptance. We can change the world, if you acknowledge
                        them. You may not see the value your acceptance gives the world. But this
                        you surely want; you can exchange all suffering for joy this very day.
                        Practice in earnest, and the gift is yours. Would God deceive you? Can His
                        promise fail? Can you withhold so little, when His Hand holds out complete
                        salvation to His Son? </para>

                    <title>Lesson 165. Let not my mind deny the Thought of God.</title>
                    <para> What makes this world seem real except your own denial of the truth that
                        lies beyond? What but your thoughts of misery and death obscure the perfect
                        happiness and the eternal life your Father wills for you? And what could
                        hide what cannot be concealed except illusion? What could keep from you what
                        you already have except your choice to see it not, denying it is there? </para>
                    <para> The Thought of God created you. It left you not, nor have you ever been
                        apart from it an instant. It belongs to you. By it you live. It is your
                        Source of life, holding you one with it, and everything is one with you
                        because it left you not. The Thought of God protects you, cares for you,
                        makes soft your resting place and smooth your way, lighting your mind with
                        happiness and love. Eternity and everlasting life shine in your mind,
                        because the Thought of God has left you not, and still abides with you. </para>
                    <para> Who would deny his safety and his peace, his joy, his healing and his
                        peace of mind, his quiet rest, his calm awakening, if he but recognized
                        where they abide? Would he not instantly prepare to go where they are found,
                        abandoning all else as worthless in comparison with them? And having found
                        them, would he not make sure they stay with him, and he remain with them? </para>
                    <para> Deny not Heaven. It is yours today, but for the asking. Nor need you
                        perceive how great the gift, how changed your mind will be before it comes
                        to you. Ask to receive, and it is given you. Conviction lies within it. Till
                        you welcome it as yours, uncertainty remains. Yet God is fair. Sureness is
                        not required to receive what only your acceptance can bestow. </para>
                    <para> Ask with desire. You need not be sure that you request the only thing you
                        want. But when you have received, you will be sure you have the treasure you
                        have always sought. What would you then exchange for it? What would induce
                        you now to let it fade away from your ecstatic vision? For this sight proves
                        that you have exchanged your blindness for the seeing eyes of Christ; your
                        mind has come to lay aside denial, and accept the Thought of God as your
                        inheritance. </para>
                    <para> Now is all doubting past, the journey's end made certain, and salvation
                        given you. Now is Christ's power in your mind, to heal as you were healed.
                        For now you are among the saviors of the world. Your destiny lies there and
                        nowhere else. Would God consent to let His Son remain forever starved by his
                        denial of the nourishment he needs to live? Abundance dwells in him, and
                        deprivation cannot cut him off from God's sustaining Love and from his home. </para>
                    <para> Practice today in hope. For hope indeed is justified. Your doubts are
                        meaningless, for God is certain. And the Thought of Him is never absent.
                        Sureness must abide within you who are host to Him. This course removes all
                        doubts which you have interposed between Him and your certainty of Him. </para>
                    <para> We count on God, and not upon ourselves, to give us certainty. And in His
                        Name we practice as His Word directs we do. His sureness lies beyond our
                        every doubt. His Love remains beyond our every fear. The Thought of Him is
                        still beyond all dreams and in our minds, according to His Will. </para>

                    <title>Lesson 166. I am entrusted with the gifts of God. </title>
                    <para> All things are given you. God's trust in you is limitless. He knows His
                        Son. He gives without exception, holding nothing back that can contribute to
                        your happiness. And yet, unless your will is one with His, His gifts are not
                        received. But what would make you think there is another will than His? </para>
                    <para> Here is the paradox that underlies the making of the world. This world is
                        not the Will of God, and so it is not real. Yet those who think it real must
                        still believe there is another will, and one that leads to opposite effects
                        from those He wills. Impossible indeed; but every mind that looks upon the
                        world and judges it as certain, solid, trustworthy and true believes in two
                        creators; or in one, himself alone. But never in one God. </para>
                    <para> The gifts of God are not acceptable to anyone who holds such strange
                        beliefs. He must believe that to accept God's gifts, however evident they
                        may become, however urgently he may be called to claim them as his own, is
                        to be pressed to treachery against himself. He must deny their presence,
                        contradict the truth, and suffer to preserve the world he made. </para>
                    <para> Here is the only home he thinks he knows. Here is the only safety he
                        believes that he can find. Without the world he made is he an outcast;
                        homeless and afraid. He does not realize that it is here he is afraid
                        indeed, and homeless, too; an outcast wandering so far from home, so long
                        away, he does not realize he has forgotten where he came from, where he
                        goes, and even who he really is. </para>
                    <para> Yet in his lonely, senseless wanderings, God's gifts go with him, all
                        unknown to him. He cannot lose them. But he will not look at what is given
                        him. He wanders on, aware of the futility he sees about him everywhere,
                        perceiving how his little lot but dwindles, as he goes ahead to nowhere.
                        Still he wanders on in misery and poverty, alone though God is with him, and
                        a treasure his so great that everything the world contains is valueless
                        before its magnitude. </para>
                    <para> He seems a sorry figure; weary, worn, in threadbare clothing, and with
                        feet that bleed a little from the rocky road he walks. No one but has
                        identified with him, for everyone who comes here has pursued the path he
                        follows, and has felt defeat and hopelessness as he is feeling them. Yet is
                        he really tragic, when you see that he is following the way he chose, and
                        need but realize Who walks with him and open up his treasures to be free? </para>
                    <para> This is your chosen self, the one you made as a replacement for reality.
                        This is the self you savagely defend against all reason, every evidence, and
                        all the witnesses with proof to show this is not you. You heed them not. You
                        go on your appointed way, with eyes cast down lest you might catch a glimpse
                        of truth, and be released from self-deception and set free. </para>
                    <para> You cower fearfully lest you should feel Christ's touch upon your
                        shoulder, and perceive His gentle hand directing you to look upon your
                        gifts. How could you then proclaim your poverty in exile? He would make you
                        laugh at this perception of yourself. Where is self-pity then? And what
                        becomes of all the tragedy you sought to make for him whom God intended only
                        joy? </para>
                    <para> Your ancient fear has come upon you now, and justice has caught up with
                        you at last. Christ's hand has touched your shoulder, and you feel that you
                        are not alone. You even think the miserable self you thought was you may not
                        be your Identity. Perhaps God's Word is truer than your own. Perhaps His
                        gifts to you are real. Perhaps He has not wholly been outwitted by your plan
                        to keep His Son in deep oblivion, and go the way you chose without your
                        Self. </para>
                    <para> God's Will does not oppose. It merely is. It is not God you have
                        imprisoned in your plan to lose your Self. He does not know about a plan so
                        alien to His Will. There was a need He did not understand, to which He gave
                        an Answer. That is all. And you who have this Answer given you have need no
                        more of anything but this. </para>
                    <para> Now do we live, for now we cannot die. The wish for death is answered,
                        and the sight that looked upon it now has been replaced by vision which
                        perceives that you are not what you pretend to be. One walks with you Who
                        gently answers all your fears with this one merciful reply, "It is not so."
                        He points to all the gifts you have each time the thought of poverty
                        oppresses you, and speaks of His Companionship when you perceive yourself as
                        lonely and afraid. </para>
                    <para> Yet He reminds you still of one thing more you had forgotten. For His
                        touch on you has made you like Himself. The gifts you have are not for you
                        alone. What He has come to offer you, you now must learn to give. This is
                        the lesson that His giving holds, for He has saved you from the solitude you
                        sought to make in which to hide from God. He has reminded you of all the
                        gifts that God has given you. He speaks as well of what becomes your will
                        when you accept these gifts, and recognize they are your own. </para>
                    <para> The gifts are yours, entrusted to your care, to give to all who chose the
                        lonely road you have escaped. They do not understand they but pursue their
                        wishes. It is you who teach them now. For you have learned of Christ there
                        is another way for them to walk. Teach them by showing them the happiness
                        that comes to those who feel the touch of Christ, and recognize God's gifts.
                        Let sorrow not tempt you to be unfaithful to your trust. </para>
                    <para> Your sighs will now betray the hopes of those who look to you for their
                        release. Your tears are theirs. If you are sick, you but withhold their
                        healing. What you fear but teaches them their fears are justified. Your hand
                        becomes the giver of Christ's touch; your change of mind becomes the proof
                        that who accepts God's gifts can never suffer anything. You are entrusted
                        with the world's release from pain. </para>
                    <para> Betray it not. Become the living proof of what Christ's touch can offer
                        everyone. God has entrusted all His gifts to you. Be witness in your
                        happiness to how transformed the mind becomes which chooses to accept His
                        gifts, and feel the touch of Christ. Such is your mission now. For God
                        entrusts the giving of His gifts to all who have received them. He has
                        shared His joy with you. And now you go to share it with the world. </para>

                    <title>Lesson 167. There is one life, and that I share with God. </title>
                    <para> There are not different kinds of life, for life is like the truth. It
                        does not have degrees. It is the one condition in which all that God created
                        share. Like all His Thoughts, it has no opposite. There is no death because
                        what God created shares His life. There is no death because an opposite to
                        God does not exist. There is no death because the Father and the Son are
                        One. </para>
                    <para> In this world, there appears to be a state that is life's opposite. You
                        call it death. Yet we have learned that the idea of death takes many forms.
                        It is the one idea which underlies all feelings that are not supremely
                        happy. It is the alarm to which you give response of any kind that is not
                        perfect joy. All sorrow, loss, anxiety and suffering and pain, even a little
                        sigh of weariness, a slight discomfort or the merest frown, acknowledge
                        death. And thus deny you live. </para>
                    <para> You think that death is of the body. Yet it is but an idea, irrelevant to
                        what is seen as physical. A thought is in the mind. It can be then applied
                        as mind directs it. But its origin is where it must be changed, if change
                        occurs. Ideas leave not their source. The emphasis this course has placed on
                        that idea is due to its centrality in our attempts to change your mind about
                        yourself. It is the reason you can heal. It is the cause of healing. It is
                        why you cannot die. Its truth established you as one with God. </para>
                    <para> Death is the thought that you are separate from your Creator. It is the
                        belief conditions change, emotions alternate because of causes you cannot
                        control, you did not make, and you can never change. It is the fixed belief
                        ideas can leave their source, and take on qualities the source does not
                        contain, becoming different from their own origin, apart from it in kind as
                        well as distance, time and form. </para>
                    <para> Death cannot come from life. Ideas remain united to their source. They
                        can extend all that their source contains. In that, they can go far beyond
                        themselves. But they can not give birth to what was never given them. As
                        they are made, so will their making be. As they were born, so will they then
                        give birth. And where they come from, there will they return. </para>
                    <para> The mind can think it sleeps, but that is all. It cannot change what is
                        its waking state. It cannot make a body, nor abide within a body. What is
                        alien to the mind does not exist, because it has no source. For mind creates
                        all things that are, and cannot give them attributes it lacks, nor change
                        its own eternal, mindful state. It cannot make the physical. What seems to
                        die is but the sign of mind asleep. </para>
                    <para> The opposite of life can only be another form of life. As such, it can be
                        reconciled with what created it, because it is not opposite in truth. Its
                        form may change; it may appear to be what it is not. Yet mind is mind, awake
                        or sleeping. It is not its opposite in anything created, nor in what it
                        seems to make when it believes it sleeps. </para>
                    <para> God creates only mind awake. He does not sleep, and His creations cannot
                        share what He gives not, nor make conditions which He does not share with
                        them. The thought of death is not the opposite to thoughts of life. Forever
                        unopposed by opposites of any kind, the Thoughts of God remain forever
                        changeless, with the power to extend forever changelessly, but yet within
                        themselves, for they are everywhere. </para>
                    <para> What seems to be the opposite of life is merely sleeping. When the mind
                        elects to be what it is not, and to assume an alien power which it does not
                        have, a foreign state it cannot enter, or a false condition not within its
                        Source, it merely seems to go to sleep a while. It dreams of time; an
                        interval in which what seems to happen never has occurred, the changes
                        wrought are substanceless, and all events are nowhere. When the mind awakes,
                        it but continues as it always was. </para>
                    <para> Let us today be children of the truth, and not deny our holy heritage.
                        Our life is not as we imagine it. Who changes life because he shuts his
                        eyes, or makes himself what he is not because he sleeps, and sees in dreams
                        an opposite to what he is? We will not ask for death in any form today. Nor
                        will we let imagined opposites to life abide even an instant where the
                        Thought of life eternal has been set by God Himself. </para>
                    <para> His holy home we strive to keep today as He established it, and wills it
                        be forever and forever. He is Lord of what we think today. And in His
                        Thoughts, which have no opposite, we understand there is one life, and that
                        we share with Him, with all creation, with their thoughts as well, whom He
                        created in a unity of life that cannot separate in death and leave the
                        Source of life from where it came. </para>
                    <para> We share one life because we have one Source, a Source from which
                        perfection comes to us, remaining always in the holy minds which He created
                        perfect. As we were, so are we now and will forever be. A sleeping mind must
                        waken, as it sees its own perfection mirroring the Lord of life so perfectly
                        it fades into what is reflected there. And now it is no more a mere
                        reflection. It becomes the thing reflected, and the light which makes
                        reflection possible. No vision now is needed. For the wakened mind is one
                        that knows its Source, its Self, its Holiness. </para>

                    <para> God speaks to us. Shall we not speak to Him? He is not distant. He makes
                        no attempt to hide from us. We try to hide from Him, and suffer from
                        deception. He remains entirely accessible. He loves His Son. There is no
                        certainty but this, yet this suffices. He will love His Son forever. When
                        his mind remains asleep, He loves him still. And when his mind awakes, He
                        loves him with a never-changing Love. </para>
                    <para> If you but knew the meaning of His Love, hope and despair would be
                        impossible. For hope would be forever satisfied; despair of any kind
                        unthinkable. His grace His answer is to all despair, for in it lies
                        remembrance of His Love. Would He not gladly give the means by which His
                        Will is recognized? His grace is yours by your acknowledgment. And memory of
                        Him awakens in the mind that asks the means of Him whereby its sleep is
                        done. </para>
                    <para> Today we ask of God the gift He has most carefully preserved within our
                        hearts, waiting to be acknowledged. This the gift by which God leans to us
                        and lifts us up, taking salvation's final step Himself. All steps but this
                        we learn, instructed by His Voice. But finally He comes Himself, and takes
                        us in His Arms and sweeps away the cobwebs of our sleep. His gift of grace
                        is more than just an answer. It restores all memories the sleeping mind
                        forgot; all certainty of what Love's meaning is. </para>

                        as theirs. What now remains that Heaven be delayed an instant longer? What

                    <para> It is a new and holy day today, for we receive what has been given us.
                        Our faith lies in the Giver, not our own acceptance. We acknowledge our
                        mistakes, but He to Whom all error is unknown is yet the One Who answers our
                        mistakes by giving us the means to lay them down, and rise to Him in

                    <para> Grace is an aspect of the Love of God which is most like the state
                        prevailing in the unity of truth. It is the world's most lofty aspiration,
                        for it leads beyond the world entirely. It is past learning, yet the goal of
                        learning, for grace cannot come until the mind prepares itself for true
                        acceptance. Grace becomes inevitable instantly in those who have prepared a
                        table where it can be gently laid and willingly received; an altar clean and
                        holy for the gift. </para>
                    <para> Grace is acceptance of the Love of God within a world of seeming hate and
                        fear. By grace alone the hate and fear are gone, for grace presents a state
                        so opposite to everything the world contains, that those whose minds are
                        lighted by the gift of grace can not believe the world of fear is real. </para>
                    <para> Grace is not learned. The final step must go beyond all learning. Grace
                        is not the goal this course aspires to attain. Yet we prepare for grace in
                        that an open mind can hear the Call to waken. It is not shut tight against
                        God's Voice. It has become aware that there are things it does not know, and
                        thus is ready to accept a state completely different from experience with
                        which it is familiarly at home. </para>
                    <para> We have perhaps appeared to contradict our statement that the revelation
                        of the Father and the Son as One has been already set. But we have also said
                        the mind determines when that time will be, and has determined it. And yet
                        we urge you to bear witness to the Word of God to hasten the experience of
                        truth, and speed its advent into every mind that recognizes truth's effects
                        on you. </para>
                    <para> Oneness is simply the idea God is. And in His Being, He encompasses all
                        things. No mind holds anything but Him. We say "God is," and then we cease
                        to speak, for in that knowledge words are meaningless. There are no lips to
                        speak them, and no part of mind sufficiently distinct to feel that it is now
                        aware of something not itself. It has united with its Source. And like its
                        Source Itself, it merely is. </para>
                    <para> We cannot speak nor write nor even think of this at all. It comes to
                        every mind when total recognition that its will is God's has been completely
                        given and received completely. It returns the mind into the endless present,
                        where the past and future cannot be conceived. It lies beyond salvation;
                        past all thought of time, forgiveness and the holy face of Christ. The Son
                        of God has merely disappeared into his Father, as his Father has in him. The
                        world has never been at all. Eternity remains a constant state. </para>
                    <para> This is beyond experience we try to hasten. Yet forgiveness, taught and
                        learned, brings with it the experiences which bear witness that the time the
                        mind itself determined to abandon all but this is now at hand. We do not
                        hasten it, in that what you will offer was concealed from Him Who teaches
                        what forgiveness means. </para>
                    <para> All learning was already in His Mind, accomplished and complete. He
                        recognized all that time holds, and gave it to all minds that each one might
                        determine, from a point where time was ended, when it is released to
                        revelation and eternity. We have repeated several times before that you but
                        make a journey that is done. </para>
                    <para> For oneness must be here. Whatever time the mind has set for revelation
                        is entirely irrelevant to what must be a constant state, forever as it
                        always was; forever to remain as it is now. We merely take the part assigned
                        long since, and fully recognized as perfectly fulfilled by Him Who wrote
                        salvation's script in His Creator's Name, and in the Name of His Creator's
                        Son. </para>
                    <para> There is no need to further clarify what no one in the world can
                        understand. When revelation of your oneness comes, it will be known and
                        fully understood. Now we have work to do, for those in time can speak of
                        things beyond, and listen to words which explain what is to come is past
                        already. Yet what meaning can the words convey to those who count the hours
                        still, and rise and work and go to sleep by them? </para>
                    <para> Suffice it, then, that you have work to do to play your part. The ending
                        must remain obscure to you until your part is done. It does not matter. For
                        your part is still what all the rest depends on. As you take the role
                        assigned to you, salvation comes a little nearer each uncertain heart that
                        does not beat as yet in tune with God. </para>
                    <para> Forgiveness is the central theme that runs throughout salvation, holding
                        all its parts in meaningful relationships, the course it runs directed and
                        its outcome sure. And now we ask for grace, the final gift salvation can
                        bestow. Experience that grace provides will end in time, for grace
                        foreshadows Heaven, yet does not replace the thought of time but for a
                        little while. </para>
                    <para> The interval suffices. It is here that miracles are laid; to be returned
                        by you from holy instants you receive, through grace in your experience, to
                        all who see the light that lingers in your face. What is the face of Christ
                        but his who went a moment into timelessness, and brought a clear reflection
                        of the unity he felt an instant back to bless the world? How could you
                        finally attain to it forever, while a part of you remains outside,
                        unknowing, unawakened, and in need of you as witness to the truth? </para>
                    <para> Be grateful to return, as you were glad to go an instant, and accept the
                        gifts that grace provided you. You carry them back to yourself. And
                        revelation stands not far behind. Its coming is ensured. We ask for grace,
                        and for experience that comes from grace. We welcome the release it offers
                        everyone. We do not ask for the unaskable. We do not look beyond what grace
                        can give. For this we can give in the grace that has been given us. </para>
                    <para> Our learning goal today does not exceed this prayer. Yet in the world,
                        what could be more than what we ask this day of Him Who gives the grace we
                        ask, as it was given Him? </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>By grace I live. By grace I am                                released.By grace I give. By                                grace I will release. </para>

                    <title>Lesson 170. There is no cruelty in God and none in me. </title>
                    <para> No one attacks without intent to hurt. This can have no exception. When
                        you think that you attack in self-defense, you mean that to be cruel is
                        protection; you are safe because of cruelty. You mean that you believe to
                        hurt another brings you freedom. And you mean that to attack is to exchange
                        the state in which you are for something better, safer, more secure from
                        dangerous invasion and from fear. </para>
                    <para> How thoroughly insane is the idea that to defend from fear is to attack!
                        For here is fear begot and fed with blood, to make it grow and swell and
                        rage. And thus is fear protected, not escaped. Today we learn a lesson which
                        can save you more delay and needless misery than you can possibly imagine.
                        It is this: </para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>You make what you defend against, and by your
                                own defense against it is it real and inescapable. Lay down your
                                arms, and only then do you perceive it false. </para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para> It seems to be the enemy without that you attack. Yet your defense sets
                        up an enemy within; an alien thought at war with you, depriving you of
                        peace, splitting your mind into two camps which seem wholly irreconcilable.
                        For love now has an "enemy," an opposite; and fear, the alien, now needs
                        your defense against the threat of what you really are. </para>
                    <para> If you consider carefully the means by which your fancied self-defense
                        proceeds on its imagined way, you will perceive the premises on which the
                        idea stands. First, it is obvious ideas must leave their source, for it is
                        you who make attack, and must have first conceived of it. Yet you attack
                        outside yourself, and separate your mind from him who is to be attacked,
                        with perfect faith the split you made is real. </para>
                    <para> Next, are the attributes of love bestowed upon its "enemy." For fear
                        becomes your safety and protector of your peace, to which you turn for
                        solace and escape from doubts about your strength, and hope of rest in
                        dreamless quiet. And as love is shorn of what belongs to it and it alone,
                        love is endowed with attributes of fear. For love would ask you lay down all
                        defense as merely foolish. And your arms indeed would crumble into dust. For
                        such they are. </para>
                    <para> With love as enemy, must cruelty become a god. And gods demand that those
                        who worship them obey their dictates, and refuse to question them. Harsh
                        punishment is meted out relentlessly to those who ask if the demands are
                        sensible or even sane. It is their enemies who are unreasonable and insane,
                        while they are always merciful and just. </para>
                    <para> Today we look upon this cruel god dispassionately. And we note that
                        though his lips are smeared with blood, and fire seems to flame from him, he
                        is but made of stone. He can do nothing. We need not defy his power. He has
                        none. And those who see in him their safety have no guardian, no strength to
                        call upon in danger, and no mighty warrior to fight for them. </para>
                    <para> This moment can be terrible. But it can also be the time of your release
                        from abject slavery. You make a choice, standing before this idol, seeing
                        him exactly as he is. Will you restore to love what you have sought to wrest
                        from it and lay before this mindless piece of stone? Or will you make
                        another idol to replace it? For the god of cruelty takes many forms. Another
                        can be found. </para>
                    <para> Yet do not think that fear is the escape from fear. Let us remember what
                        the text has stressed about the obstacles to peace. The final one, the
                        hardest to believe is nothing, and a seeming obstacle with the appearance of
                        a solid block, impenetrable, fearful and beyond surmounting, is the fear of
                        God Himself. Here is the basic premise which enthrones the thought of fear
                        as god. For fear is loved by those who worship it, and love appears to be
                        invested now with cruelty. </para>
                    <para> Where does the totally insane belief in gods of vengeance come from? Love
                        has not confused its attributes with those of fear. Yet must the worshippers
                        of fear perceive their own confusion in fear's "enemy"; its cruelty as now a
                        part of love. And what becomes more fearful than the Heart of Love Itself?
                        The blood appears to be upon His Lips; the fire comes from Him. And He is
                        terrible above all else, cruel beyond conception, striking down all who
                        acknowledge Him to be their God. </para>
                    <para> The choice you make today is certain. For you look for the last time upon
                        this bit of carven stone you made, and call it god no longer. You have
                        reached this place before, but you have chosen that this cruel god remain
                        with you in still another form. And so the fear of God returned with you.
                        This time you leave it there. And you return to a new world, unburdened by
                        its weight; beheld not in its sightless eyes, but in the vision that your
                        choice restored to you. </para>
                    <para> Now do your eyes belong to Christ, and He looks through them. Now your
                        voice belongs to God and echoes His. And now your heart remains at peace
                        forever. You have chosen Him in place of idols, and your attributes, given
                        by your Creator, are restored to you at last. The Call for God is heard and
                        answered. Now has fear made way for love, as God Himself replaces cruelty. </para>
                    <para>Father, we are like You. No cruelty abides in us,
                            for there is none in You. Your peace is ours. And we bless the world
                            with what we have received from You alone. We choose again, and make our
                            choice for all our brothers, knowing they are one with us. We bring them
                            Your salvation as we have received it now. And we give thanks for them
                            who render us complete. In them we see Your glory, and in them we find
                            our peace. Holy are we because Your Holiness has set us free. And we
                            give thanks. Amen. </para>

                    <title>Review V Introduction (Lessons 151 - 170)</title>
                    <para>We now review again. This time we are ready to give more effort and more
                        time to what we undertake. We recognize we are preparing for another phase
                        of understanding. We would take this step completely, that we may go on
                        again more certain, more sincere, with faith upheld more surely. Our
                        footsteps have not been unwavering, and doubts have made us walk uncertainly
                        and slowly on the road this course sets forth. But now we hasten on, for we
                        approach a greater certainty, a firmer purpose and a surer goal.</para>
                    <para>Steady our feet, our Father. Let our doubts be quiet and our holy minds be
                        still, and speak to us. We have no words to give to You. We would but listen
                        to Your Word, and make it ours. Lead our practicing as does a father lead a
                        little child along a way he does not understand. Yet does he follow, sure
                        that he is safe because his father leads the way for him.</para>
                    <para>So do we bring our practicing to You. And if we stumble, You will raise us
                        up. If we forget the way, we count upon Your sure remembering. We wander
                        off, but You will not forget to call us back. Quicken our footsteps now,
                        that we may walk more certainly and quickly unto You. And we accept the Word
                        You offer us to unify our practicing, as we review the thoughts that You
                        have given us.</para>
                    <para>This is the thought which should precede the thoughts that we review. Each
                        one but clarifies some aspect of this thought, or helps it be more
                        meaningful, more personal and true, and more descriptive of the holy Self we
                        share and now prepare to know again:</para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>God is but Love, and therefore so am                                I.</para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>This Self alone knows Love. This Self alone is perfectly consistent in Its
                        Thoughts; knows Its Creator, understands Itself, is perfect in Its knowledge
                        and Its Love, and never changes from Its constant state of union with Its
                        Father and Itself.</para>
                    <para>And it is this that waits to meet us at the journey's ending. Every step
                        we take brings us a little nearer. This review will shorten time
                        immeasurably, if we keep in mind that this remains our goal, and as we
                        practice it is this to which we are approaching. Let us raise our hearts
                        from dust to life, as we remember this is promised us, and that this course
                        was sent to open up the path of light to us, and teach us, step by step, how
                        to return to the eternal Self we thought we lost.</para>
                    <para>I take the journey with you. For I share your doubts and fears a little
                        while, that you may come to me who recognize the road by which all fears and
                        doubts are overcome. We walk together. I must understand uncertainty and
                        pain, although I know they have no meaning. Yet a savior must remain with
                        those he teaches, seeing what they see, but still retaining in his mind the
                        way that led him out, and now will lead you out with him. God's Son is
                        crucified until you walk along the road with me.</para>
                    <para>My resurrection comes again each time I lead a brother safely to the place
                        at which the journey ends and is forgot. I am renewed each time a brother
                        learns there is a way from misery and pain. I am reborn each time a
                        brother's mind turns to the light in him and looks for me. I have forgotten
                        no one. Help me now to lead you back to where the journey was begun, to make
                        another choice with me.</para>
                    <para>Release me as you practice once again the thoughts I brought to you from
                        Him Who sees your bitter need, and knows the answer God has given Him.
                        Together we review these thoughts. Together we devote our time and effort to
                        them. And together we will teach them to our brothers. God would not have
                        Heaven incomplete. It waits for you, as I do. I am incomplete without your
                        part in me. And as I am made whole we go together to our ancient home,
                        prepared for us before time was and kept unchanged by time, immaculate and
                        safe, as it will be at last when time is done.</para>
                    <para>Let this review be then your gift to me. For this alone I need; that you
                        will hear the words I speak, and give them to the world. You are my voice,
                        my eyes, my feet, my hands through which I save the world. The Self from
                        which I call to you is but your own. To Him we go together. Take your
                        brother's hand, for this is not a way we walk alone. In him I walk with you,
                        and you with me. Our Father wills His Son be one with Him. What lives but
                        must not then be one with you?</para>
                    <para>Let this review become a time in which we share a new experience for you,
                        yet one as old as time and older still. Hallowed your Name. Your glory
                        undefiled forever. And your wholeness now complete, as God established it.
                        You are His Son, completing His extension in your own. We practice but an
                        ancient truth we knew before illusion seemed to claim the world. And we
                        remind the world that it is free of all illusions every time we say:</para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>God is but Love, and therefore so am                                I.</para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>With this we start each day of our review. With this we start and end each
                        period of practice time. And with this thought we sleep, to waken once again
                        with these same words upon our lips, to greet another day. No thought that
                        we review but we surround with it, and use the thoughts to hold it up before
                        our minds, and keep it clear in our rememberance throughout the day. And
                        thus, when we have finished this review, we will have recognized the words
                        we speak are true.</para>
                    <para>Yet are the words but aids, and to be used, except at the beginning and
                        the end of practice periods, but to recall the mind, as needed, to its
                        purpose. We place faith in the experience that comes from practice, not the
                        means we use. We wait for the experience, and recognize that it is only here
                        conviction lies. We use the words, and try and try again to go beyond them
                        to their meaning, which is far beyond their sound. The sound grows dim and
                        disappears, as we approach the Source of meaning. It is Here that we find
                        rest.</para>

                    <title>Introduction to lessons 181 - 200</title>
                    <para>Our next few lessons make a special point of firming up your willingness
                        to make your weak commitment strong; your scattered goals blend into one
                        intent. You are not asked for total dedication all the time as yet. But you
                        are asked to practice now in order to attain the sense of peace such unified
                        commitment will bestow, if only intermittently. It is experiencing this that
                        makes it sure that you will give your total willingness to following the way
                        the course sets forth.</para>
                    <para>Our lessons now are geared specifically to widening horizons, and direct
                        approaches to the special blocks that keep your vision narrow, and too
                        limited to let you see the value of our goal. We are attempting now to lift
                        these blocks, however briefly. Words alone can not convey the sense of
                        liberation which their lifting brings. But the experience of freedom and of
                        peace that comes as you give up your tight control of what you see speaks
                        for itself. Your motivation will be so intensified that words become of
                        little consequence. You will be sure of what you want, and what is
                        valueless.</para>
                    <para>And so we start our journey beyond words by concentrating first on what
                        impedes your progress still. Experience of what exists beyond defensiveness
                        remains beyond achievement while it is denied. It may be there, but you
                        cannot accept its presence. So we now attempt to go past all defenses for a
                        little while each day. No more than this is asked, because no more than this
                        is needed. It will be enough to guarantee the rest will come.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 181. I trust my brothers, who are one with me.</title>
                    <subtitle>
                        <link xlink:href="#c6-intro">See section introduction</link>
                    </subtitle>
                    <para>Trusting your brothers is essential to establishing and holding up your
                        faith in your ability to transcend doubt and lack of sure conviction in
                        yourself. When you attack a brother, you proclaim that he is limited by what
                        you have perceived in him. You do not look beyond his errors. Rather, they
                        are magnified, becoming blocks to your awareness of the Self that lies
                        beyond your own mistakes, and past his seeming sins as well as yours.</para>
                    <para>Perception has a focus. It is this that gives consistency to what you see.
                        Change but this focus, and what you behold will change accordingly. Your
                        vision now will shift, to give support to the intent which has replaced the
                        one you held before. Remove your focus on your brother's sins, and you
                        experience the peace that comes from faith in sinlessness. This faith
                        receives its only sure support from what you see in others past their sins.
                        For their mistakes, if focused on, are witnesses to sins in you. And you
                        will not transcend their sight and see the sinlessness that lies
                        beyond.</para>
                    <para>Therefore, in practicing today, we first let all such little focuses give
                        way to our great need to let our sinlessness become apparent. We instruct
                        our minds that it is this we seek, and only this, for just a little while.
                        We do not care about our future goals. And what we saw an instant previous
                        has no concern for us within this interval of time wherein we practice
                        changing our intent. We seek for innocence and nothing else. We seek for it
                        with no concern but now.</para>
                    <para>A major hazard to success has been involvement with your past and future
                        goals. You have been quite preoccupied with how extremely different the
                        goals this course is advocating are from those you held before. And you have
                        also been dismayed by the depressing and restricting thought that, even if
                        you should succeed, you will inevitably lose your way again. </para>
                    <para>How could this matter? For the past is gone; the future but imagined.
                        These concerns are but defenses against present change of focus in
                        perception. Nothing more. We lay these pointless limitations by a little
                        while. We do not look to past beliefs, and what we will believe will not
                        intrude upon us now. We enter in the time of practicing with one intent; to
                        look upon the sinlessness within.</para>
                    <para>We recognize that we have lost this goal if anger blocks our way in any
                        form. And if a brother's sins occur to us, our narrowed focus will restrict
                        our sight, and turn our eyes upon our own mistakes, which we will magnify
                        and call our "sins." So, for a little while, without regard to past or
                        future, should such blocks arise we will transcend them with instructions to
                        our minds to change their focus, as we say:<blockquote>
                            <para>It is not this that I would look upon.</para>
                            <para>I trust my brothers, who are one with                                me.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>And we will also use this thought to keep us safe throughout the day. We
                        do not seek for long-range goals. As each obstruction seems to block the
                        vision of our sinlessness, we seek but for surcease an instant from the
                        misery the focus upon sin will bring, and uncorrected will remain.</para>
                    <para>Nor do we ask for fantasies. For what we seek to look upon is really
                        there. And as our focus goes beyond mistakes, we will behold a wholly
                        sinless world. When seeing this is all we want to see, when this is all we
                        seek for in the name of true perception, are the eyes of Christ inevitably
                        ours. And the Love He feels for us becomes our own as well. This will become
                        the only thing we see reflected in the world and in ourselves.</para>
                    <para>The world which once proclaimed our sins becomes the proof that we are
                        sinless. And our love for everyone we look upon attests to our remembrance
                        of the holy Self which knows no sin, and never could conceive of anything
                        without Its sinlessness. We seek for this remembrance as we turn our minds
                        to practicing today. We look neither ahead nor backwards. We look straight
                        into the present. And we give our trust to the experience we ask for now.
                        Our sinlessness is but the Will of God. This instant is our willing one with
                        His.</para>

                    <para>This world you seem to live in is not home to you. And somewhere in your
                        mind you know that this is true. A memory of home keeps haunting you, as if
                        there were a place that called you to return, although you do not recognize
                        the voice, nor what it is the voice reminds you of. Yet still you feel an
                        alien here, from somewhere all unknown. Nothing so definite that you could
                        say with certainty you are an exile here. Just a persistent feeling,
                        sometimes not more than a tiny throb, at other times hardly remembered,
                        actively dismissed, but surely to return to mind again.</para>
                    <para>No one but knows whereof we speak. Yet some try to put by their suffering
                        in games they play to occupy their time, and keep their sadness from them.
                        Others will deny that they are sad, and do not recognize their tears at all.
                        Still others will maintain that what we speak of is illusion, not to be
                        considered more than but a dream. Yet who, in simple honesty, without
                        defensiveness and self-deception, would deny he understands the words we
                        speak?</para>
                    <para>We speak today for everyone who walks this world, for he is not at home.
                        He goes uncertainly about in endless search, seeking in darkness what he
                        cannot find; not recognizing what it is he seeks. A thousand homes he makes,
                        yet none contents his restless mind. He does not understand he builds in
                        vain. The home he seeks can not be made by him. There is no substitute for
                        Heaven. All he ever made was hell.</para>
                    <para>Perhaps you think it is your childhood home that you would find again. The
                        childhood of your body, and its place of shelter, are a memory now so
                        distorted that you merely hold a picture of a past that never happened. Yet
                        there is a Child in you Who seeks His Father's house, and knows that He is
                        alien here. This childhood is eternal, with an innocence that will endure
                        forever. Where this Child shall go is holy ground. It is His Holiness that
                        lights up Heaven, and that brings to earth the pure reflection of the light
                        above, wherein are earth and Heaven joined as one.</para>
                    <para>It is this Child in you your Father knows as His Own Son. It is this Child
                        Who knows His Father. He desires to go home so deeply, so unceasingly, His
                        voice cries unto you to let Him rest a while. He does not ask for more than
                        just a few instants of respite; just an interval in which He can return to
                        breathe again the holy air that fills His Father's house. You are His home
                        as well. He will return. But give Him just a little time to be Himself,
                        within the peace that is His home, resting in silence and in peace and
                        love.</para>
                    <para>This Child needs your protection. He is far from home. He is so little
                        that He seems so easily shut out, His tiny voice so readily obscured, His
                        call for help almost unheard amid the grating sounds and harsh and rasping
                        noises of the world. Yet does He know that in you still abides His sure
                        protection. You will fail Him not. He will go home, and you along with
                        Him.</para>
                    <para>This Child is your defenselessness; your strength. He trusts in you. He
                        came because He knew you would not fail. He whispers of His home unceasingly
                        to you. For He would bring you back with Him, that He Himself might stay,
                        and not return again where He does not belong, and where He lives an outcast
                        in a world of alien thoughts. His patience has no limits. He will wait until
                        you hear His gentle Voice within you, calling you to let Him go in peace,
                        along with you, to where He is at home and you with Him.</para>
                    <para>When you are still an instant, when the world recedes from you, when
                        valueless ideas cease to have value in your restless mind, then will you
                        hear His Voice. So poignantly He calls to you that you will not resist Him
                        longer. In that instant He will take you to His home, and you will stay with
                        Him in perfect stillness, silent and at peace, beyond all words, untouched
                        by fear and doubt, sublimely certain that you are at home.</para>
                    <para>Rest with Him frequently today. For He was willing to become a little
                        Child that you might learn of Him how strong is he who comes without
                        defenses, offering only love's messages to those who think he is their
                        enemy. He holds the might of Heaven in His hand and calls them friend, and
                        gives His strength to them, that they may see He would be Friend to them. He
                        asks that they protect Him, for His home is far away, and He will not return
                        to it alone.</para>
                    <para>Christ is reborn as but a little Child each time a wanderer would leave
                        his home. For he must learn that what he would protect is but this Child,
                        Who comes defenseless and Who is protected by defenselessness. Go home with
                        Him from time to time today. You are as much an alien here as He.</para>
                    <para>Take time today to lay aside your shield which profits nothing, and lay
                        down the spear and sword you raised against an enemy without existence.
                        Christ has called you friend and brother. He has even come to ask your help
                        in letting Him go home today, completed and completely. He has come as does
                        a little child, who must beseech his father for protection and for love. He
                        rules the universe, and yet He asks unceasingly that you return with Him,
                        and take illusions as your gods no more.</para>
                    <para>You have not lost your innocence. It is for this you yearn. This is your
                        heart's desire. This is the voice you hear, and this the call which cannot
                        be denied. The holy Child remains with you. His home is yours. Today He
                        gives you His defenselessness, and you accept it in exchange for all the
                        toys of battle you have made. And now the way is open, and the journey has
                        an end in sight at last. Be still an instant and go home with Him, and be at
                        peace a while.</para>

                    <title>Lesson 183. I call upon God's Name and on my own.</title>

                    <para>God's Name is holy, but no holier than yours. To call upon His Name is but
                        to call upon your own. A father gives his son his name, and thus identifies
                        the son with him. His brothers share his name, and thus are they united in a
                        bond to which they turn for their identity. Your Father's Name reminds you
                        who you are, even within a world that does not know; even though you have
                        not remembered it.</para>
                    <para>God's Name can not be heard without response, nor said without an echo in
                        the mind that calls you to remember. Say His Name, and you invite the angels
                        to surround the ground on which you stand, and sing to you as they spread
                        out their wings to keep you safe, and shelter you from every worldly thought
                        that would intrude upon your holiness.</para>
                    <para>Repeat God's Name, and all the world responds by laying down illusions.
                        Every dream the world holds dear has suddenly gone by, and where it seemed
                        to stand you find a star; a miracle of grace. The sick arise, healed of
                        their sickly thoughts. The blind can see; the deaf can hear. The sorrowful
                        cast off their mourning, and the tears of pain are dried as happy laughter
                        comes to bless the world.</para>
                    <para>Repeat the Name of God, and little names have lost their meaning. No
                        temptation but becomes a nameless and unwanted thing before God's Name.
                        Repeat His Name, and see how easily you will forget the names of all the
                        gods you valued. They have lost the name of god you gave them. They become
                        anonymous and valueless to you, although before you let the Name of God
                        replace their little names, you stood before them worshipfully, naming them
                        as gods.</para>
                    <para>Repeat the Name of God, and call upon your Self, Whose Name is His. Repeat
                        His Name, and all the tiny, nameless things on earth slip into right
                        perspective. Those who call upon the Name of God can not mistake the
                        nameless for the Name, nor sin for grace, nor bodies for the holy Son of
                        God. And should you join a brother as you sit with him in silence, and
                        repeat God's Name along with him within your quiet mind, you have
                        established there an altar which reaches to God Himself and to His
                        Son.</para>
                    <para>Practice but this today; repeat God's Name slowly again and still again.
                        Become oblivious to every name but His. Hear nothing else. Let all your
                        thoughts become anchored on this. No other word we use except at the
                        beginning, when we say today's idea but once. And then God's Name becomes
                        our only thought, our only word, the only thing that occupies our minds, the
                        only wish we have, the only sound with any meaning, and the only Name of
                        everything that we desire to see; of everything that we would call our
                        own.</para>
                    <para>Thus do we give an invitation which can never be refused. And God will
                        come, and answer it Himself. Think not He hears the little prayers of those
                        who call on Him with names of idols cherished by the world. They cannot
                        reach Him thus. He cannot hear requests that He be not Himself, or that His
                        Son receive another name than His.</para>
                    <para>Repeat God's Name, and you acknowledge Him as sole Creator of reality. And
                        you acknowledge also that His Son is part of Him, creating in His Name. Sit
                        silently, and let His Name become the all-encompassing idea that holds your
                        mind completely. Let all thoughts be still except this one. And to all other
                        thoughts respond with this, and see God's Name replace the thousand little
                        names you gave your thoughts, not realizing that there is one Name for all
                        there is, and all that there will be.</para>
                    <para>Today you can achieve a state in which you will experience the gift of
                        grace. You can escape all bondage of the world, and give the world the same
                        release you found. You can remember what the world forgot, and offer it your
                        own remembering. You can accept today the part you play in its salvation,
                        and your own as well. And both can be accomplished perfectly.</para>
                    <para>Turn to the Name of God for your release, and it is given you. No prayer
                        but this is necessary, for it holds them all within it. Words are
                        insignificant, and all requests unneeded when God's Son calls on his
                        Father's Name. His Father's Thoughts become his own. He makes his claim to
                        all his Father gave, is giving still, and will forever give. He calls on Him
                        to let all things he thought he made be nameless now, and in their place the
                        holy Name of God becomes his judgment of their worthlessness.</para>
                    <para>All little things are silent. Little sounds are soundless now. The little
                        things of earth have disappeared. The universe consists of nothing but the
                        Son of God, who calls upon his Father. And his Father's Voice gives answer
                        in his Father's holy Name. In this eternal, still relationship, in which
                        communication far transcends all words, and yet exceeds in depth and height
                        whatever words could possibly convey, is peace eternal. In our Father's
                        Name, we would experience this peace today. And in His Name, it shall be
                        given us.</para>

                    <para>You live by symbols. You have made up names for everything you see. Each
                        one becomes a separate entity, identified by its own name. By this you carve
                        it out of unity. By this you designate its special attributes, and set it
                        off from other things by emphasizing space surrounding it. This space you
                        lay between all things to which you give a different name; all happenings in
                        terms of place and time; all bodies which are greeted by a name.</para>
                    <para>This space you see as setting off all things from one another is the means
                        by which the world's perception is achieved. You see something where nothing
                        is, and see as well nothing where there is unity; a space between all
                        things, between all things and you. Thus do you think that you have given
                        life in separation. By this split you think you are established as a unity
                        which functions with an independent will.</para>
                    <para>What are these names by which the world becomes a series of discrete
                        events, of things ununified, of bodies kept apart and holding bits of mind
                        as separate awarenesses? You gave these names to them, establishing
                        perception as you wished to have perception be. The nameless things were
                        given names, and thus reality was given them as well. For what is named is
                        given meaning and will then be seen as meaningful; a cause of true effect,
                        with consequence inherent in itself.</para>
                    <para>This is the way reality is made by partial vision, purposefully set
                        against the given truth. Its enemy is wholeness. It conceives of little
                        things and looks upon them. And a lack of space, a sense of unity or vision
                        that sees differently, become the threats which it must overcome, conflict
                        with and deny.</para>
                    <para>Yet does this other vision still remain a natural direction for the mind
                        to channel its perception. It is hard to teach the mind a thousand alien
                        names, and thousands more. Yet you believe this is what learning means; its
                        one essential goal by which communication is achieved, and concepts can be
                        meaningfully shared.</para>
                    <para>This is the sum of the inheritance the world bestows. And everyone who
                        learns to think that it is so accepts the signs and symbols that assert the
                        world is real. It is for this they stand. They leave no doubt that what is
                        named is there. It can be seen, as is anticipated. What denies that it is
                        true is but illusion, for it is the ultimate reality. To question it is
                        madness; to accept its presence is the proof of sanity.</para>
                    <para>Such is the teaching of the world. It is a phase of learning everyone who
                        comes must go through. But the sooner he perceives on what it rests, how
                        questionable are its premises, how doubtful its results, the sooner does he
                        question its effects. Learning that stops with what the world would teach
                        stops short of meaning. In its proper place, it serves but as a starting
                        point from which another kind of learning can begin, a new perception can be
                        gained, and all the arbitrary names the world bestows can be withdrawn as
                        they are raised to doubt.</para>
                    <para>Think not you made the world. Illusions, yes! But what is true in earth
                        and Heaven is beyond your naming. When you call upon a brother, it is to his
                        body that you make appeal. His true Identity is hidden from you by what you
                        believe he really is. His body makes response to what you call him, for his
                        mind consents to take the name you give him as his own. And thus his unity
                        is twice denied, for you perceive him separate from you, and he accepts this
                        separate name as his.</para>
                    <para>It would indeed be strange if you were asked to go beyond all symbols of
                        the world, forgetting them forever; yet were asked to take a teaching
                        function. You have need to use the symbols of the world a while. But be you
                        not deceived by them as well. They do not stand for anything at all, and in
                        your practicing it is this thought that will release you from them. They
                        become but means by which you can communicate in ways the world can
                        understand, but which you recognize is not the unity where true
                        communication can be found.</para>
                    <para>Thus what you need are intervals each day in which the learning of the
                        world becomes a transitory phase; a prison house from which you go into the
                        sunlight and forget the darkness. Here you understand the Word, the Name
                        which God has given you; the one Identity which all things share; the one
                        acknowledgment of what is true. And then step back to darkness, not because
                        you think it real, but only to proclaim its unreality in terms which still
                        have meaning in the world that darkness rules.</para>
                    <para>Use all the little names and symbols which delineate the world of
                        darkness. Yet accept them not as your reality. The Holy Spirit uses all of
                        them, but He does not forget creation has one Name, one meaning, and a
                        single Source which unifies all things within Itself. Use all the names the
                        world bestows on them but for convenience, yet do not forget they share the
                        Name of God along with you.</para>
                    <para>God has no name. And yet His Name becomes the final lesson that all things
                        are one, and at this lesson does all learning end. All names are unified;
                        all space is filled with truth's reflection. Every gap is closed, and
                        separation healed. The Name of God is the inheritance He gave to those who
                        chose the teaching of the world to take the place of Heaven. In our
                        practicing, our purpose is to let our minds accept what God has given as the
                        answer to the pitiful inheritance you made as fitting tribute to the Son He
                        loves.</para>
                    <para>No one can fail who seeks the meaning of the Name of God. Experience must
                        come to supplement the Word. But first you must accept the Name for all
                        reality, and realize the many names you gave its aspects have distorted what
                        you see, but have not interfered with truth at all. One Name we bring into
                        our practicing. One Name we use to unify our sight.</para>
                    <para>And though we use a different name for each awareness of an aspect of
                        God's Son, we understand that they have but one Name, which He has given
                        them. It is this Name we use in practicing. And through Its use, all foolish
                        separations disappear which kept us blind. And we are given strength to see
                        beyond them. Now our sight is blessed with blessings we can give as we receive.<blockquote>
                            <para>Father, our Name is Yours. In It we are
                                    united with all living things, and You Who are their one
                                    Creator. What we made and call by many different names is but a
                                    shadow we have tried to cast across Your Own reality. And we are
                                    glad and thankful we were wrong. All our mistakes we give to
                                    You, that we may be absolved from all effects our errors seemed
                                    to have. And we accept the truth You give, in place of every one
                                    of them. Your Name is our salvation and escape from what we
                                    made. Your Name unites us in the oneness which is our
                                    inheritance and peace. Amen.</para>

                    <para>To say these words is nothing. But to mean these words is everything. If
                        you could but mean them for just an instant, there would be no further
                        sorrow possible for you in any form; in any place or time. Heaven would be
                        completely given back to full awareness, memory of God entirely restored,
                        the resurrection of all creation fully recognized.</para>
                    <para>No one can mean these words and not be healed. He cannot play with dreams,
                        nor think he is himself a dream. He cannot make a hell and think it real. He
                        wants the peace of God, and it is given him. For that is all he wants, and
                        that is all he will receive. Many have said these words. But few indeed have
                        meant them. You have but to look upon the world you see around you to be
                        sure how very few they are. The world would be completely changed, should
                        any two agree these words express the only thing they want.</para>
                    <para>Two minds with one intent become so strong that what they will becomes the
                        Will of God. For minds can only join in truth. In dreams, no two can share
                        the same intent. To each, the hero of the dream is different; the outcome
                        wanted not the same for both. Loser and gainer merely shift about in
                        changing patterns, as the ratio of gain to loss and loss to gain takes on a
                        different aspect or another form.</para>
                    <para>Yet compromise alone a dream can bring. Sometimes it takes the form of
                        union, but only the form. The meaning must escape the dream, for
                        compromising is the goal of dreaming. Minds cannot unite in dreams. They
                        merely bargain. And what bargain can give them the peace of God? Illusions
                        come to take His place. And what He means is lost to sleeping minds intent
                        on compromise, each to his gain and to another's loss.</para>
                    <para>To mean you want the peace of God is to renounce all dreams. For no one
                        means these words who wants illusions, and who therefore seeks the means
                        which bring illusions. He has looked on them, and found them wanting. Now he
                        seeks to go beyond them, recognizing that another dream would offer nothing
                        more than all the others. Dreams are one to him. And he has learned their
                        only difference is one of form, for one will bring the same despair and
                        misery as do the rest.</para>
                    <para>The mind which means that all it wants is peace must join with other
                        minds, for that is how peace is obtained. And when the wish for peace is
                        genuine, the means for finding it is given, in a form each mind that seeks
                        for it in honesty can understand. Whatever form the lesson takes is planned
                        for him in such a way that he can not mistake it, if his asking is sincere.
                        But if he asks without sincerity, there is no form in which the lesson will
                        meet with acceptance and be truly learned.</para>
                    <para>Let us today devote our practicing to recognizing that we really mean the
                        words we say. We want the peace of God. This is no idle wish. These words do
                        not request another dream be given us. They do not ask for compromise, nor
                        try to make another bargain in the hope that there may yet be one that can
                        succeed where all the rest have failed. To mean these words acknowledges
                        illusions are in vain, requesting the eternal in the place of shifting
                        dreams which seem to change in what they offer, but are one in
                        nothingness.</para>
                    <para>Today devote your practice periods to careful searching of your mind, to
                        find the dreams you cherish still. What do you ask for in your heart? Forget
                        the words you use in making your requests. Consider but what you believe
                        will comfort you, and bring you happiness. But be you not dismayed by
                        lingering illusions, for their form is not what matters now. Let not some
                        dreams be more acceptable, reserving shame and secrecy for others. They are
                        one. And being one, one question should be asked of all of them, "Is this
                        what I would have, in place of Heaven and the peace of God?"</para>
                    <para>This is the choice you make. Be not deceived that it is otherwise. No
                        compromise is possible in this. You choose God's peace, or you have asked
                        for dreams. And dreams will come as you requested them. Yet will God's peace
                        come just as certainly, and to remain with you forever. It will not be gone
                        with every twist and turning of the road, to reappear, unrecognized, in
                        forms which shift and change with every step you take.</para>
                    <para>You want the peace of God. And so do all who seem to seek for dreams. For
                        them as well as for yourself, you ask but this when you make this request
                        with deep sincerity. For thus you reach to what they really want, and join
                        your own intent with what they seek above all things, perhaps unknown to
                        them, but sure to you. You have been weak at times, uncertain in your
                        purpose, and unsure of what you wanted, where to look for it, and where to
                        turn for help in the attempt. Help has been given you. And would you not
                        avail yourself of it by sharing it?</para>
                    <para>No one who truly seeks the peace of God can fail to find it. For he merely
                        asks that he deceive himself no longer by denying to himself what is God's
                        Will. Who can remain unsatisfied who asks for what he has already? Who could
                        be unanswered who requests an answer which is his to give? The peace of God
                        is yours.</para>
                    <para>For you was peace created, given you by its Creator, and established as
                        His Own eternal gift. How can you fail, when you but ask for what He wills
                        for you? And how could your request be limited to you alone? No gift of God
                        can be unshared. It is this attribute that sets the gifts of God apart from
                        every dream that ever seemed to take the place of truth.</para>
                    <para>No one can lose and everyone must gain whenever any gift of God has been
                        requested and received by anyone. God gives but to unite. To take away is
                        meaningless to Him. And when it is as meaningless to you, you can be sure
                        you share one Will with Him, and He with you. And you will also know you
                        share one Will with all your brothers, whose intent is yours.</para>
                    <para>It is this one intent we seek today, uniting our desires with the need of
                        every heart, the call of every mind, the hope that lies beyond despair, the
                        love attack would hide, the brotherhood that hate has sought to sever, but
                        which still remains as God created it. With Help like this beside us, can we
                        fail today as we request the peace of God be given us?</para>

                    <para>Here is the statement that will one day take all arrogance away from every
                        mind. Here is the thought of true humility, which holds no function as your
                        own but that which has been given you. It offers your acceptance of a part
                        assigned to you, without insisting on another role. It does not judge your
                        proper role. It but acknowledges the Will of God is done on earth as well as
                        Heaven. It unites all wills on earth in Heaven's plan to save the world,
                        restoring it to Heaven's peace.</para>
                    <para>Let us not fight our function. We did not establish it. It is not our
                        idea. The means are given us by which it will be perfectly accomplished. All
                        that we are asked to do is to accept our part in genuine humility, and not
                        deny with self-deceiving arrogance that we are worthy. What is given us to
                        do, we have the strength to do. Our minds are suited perfectly to take the
                        part assigned to us by One Who knows us well.</para>
                    <para>Today's idea may seem quite sobering, until you see its meaning. All it
                        says is that your Father still remembers you, and offers you the perfect
                        trust He holds in you who are His Son. It does not ask that you be different
                        in any way from what you are. What could humility request but this? And what
                        could arrogance deny but this? Today we will not shrink from our assignment
                        on the specious grounds that modesty is outraged. It is pride that would
                        deny the Call for God Himself.</para>
                    <para>All false humility we lay aside today, that we may listen to God's Voice
                        reveal to us what He would have us do. We do not doubt our adequacy for the
                        function He will offer us. We will be certain only that He knows our
                        strengths, our wisdom and our holiness. And if He deems us worthy, so we
                        are. It is but arrogance that judges otherwise.</para>
                    <para>There is one way, and only one, to be released from the imprisonment your
                        plan to prove the false is true has brought to you. Accept the plan you did
                        not make instead. Judge not your value to it. If God's Voice assures you
                        that salvation needs your part, and that the whole depends on you, be sure
                        that it is so. The arrogant must cling to words, afraid to go beyond them to
                        experience which might affront their stance. Yet are the humble free to hear
                        the Voice which tells them what they are, and what to do.</para>
                    <para>Arrogance makes an image of yourself that is not real. It is this image
                        which quails and retreats in terror, as the Voice for God assures you that
                        you have the strength, the wisdom and the holiness to go beyond all images.
                        You are not weak, as is the image of yourself. You are not ignorant and
                        helpless. Sin can not tarnish the truth in you, and misery can come not near
                        the holy home of God.</para>
                    <para>All this the Voice for God relates to you. And as He speaks, the image
                        trembles and seeks to attack the threat it does not know, sensing its basis
                        crumble. Let it go. Salvation of the world depends on you, and not upon this
                        little pile of dust. What can it tell the holy Son of God? Why need he be
                        concerned with it at all?</para>
                    <para>And so we find our peace. We will accept the function God has given us,
                        for all illusions rest upon the weird belief that we can make another for
                        ourselves. Our self-made roles are shifting, and they seem to change from
                        mourner to ecstatic bliss of love and loving. We can laugh or weep, and
                        greet the day with welcome or with tears. Our very being seems to change as
                        we experience a thousand shifts in mood, and our emotions raise us high
                        indeed, or dash us to the ground in hopelessness.</para>
                    <para>Is this the Son of God? Could He create such instability and call it Son?
                        He Who is changeless shares His attributes with His creation. All the images
                        His Son appears to make have no effect on what he is. They blow across his
                        mind like wind-swept leaves that form a patterning an instant, break apart
                        to group again, and scamper off. Or like mirages seen above a desert, rising
                        from the dust.</para>
                    <para>These unsubstantial images will go, and leave your mind unclouded and
                        serene, when you accept the function given you. The images you make give
                        rise to but conflicting goals, impermanent and vague, uncertain and
                        ambiguous. Who could be constant in his efforts, or direct his energies and
                        concentrated drive toward goals like these? The functions which the world
                        esteems are so uncertain that they change ten times an hour at their most
                        secure. What hope of gain can rest on goals like this?</para>
                    <para>In lovely contrast, certain as the sun's return each morning to dispel the
                        night, your truly given function stands out clear and wholly unambiguous.
                        There is no doubt of its validity. It comes from One Who knows no error, and
                        His Voice is certain of Its messages. They will not change, nor be in
                        conflict. All of them point to one goal, and one you can attain. Your plan
                        may be impossible, but God's can never fail because He is its Source.</para>
                    <para>Do as God's Voice directs. And if It asks a thing of you which seems
                        impossible, remember Who it is that asks, and who would make denial. Then
                        consider this; which is more likely to be right? The Voice that speaks for
                        the Creator of all things, Who knows all things exactly as they are, or a
                        distorted image of yourself, confused, bewildered, inconsistent and unsure
                        of everything? Let not its voice direct you. Hear instead a certain Voice,
                        which tells you of a function given you by your Creator Who remembers you,
                        and urges that you now remember Him.</para>
                    <para>His gentle Voice is calling from the known to the unknowing. He would
                        comfort you, although He knows no sorrow. He would make a restitution,
                        though He is complete; a gift to you, although He knows that you have
                        everything already. He has Thoughts which answer every need His Son
                        perceives, although He sees them not. For Love must give, and what is given
                        in His Name takes on the form most useful in a world of form.</para>
                    <para>These are the forms which never can deceive, because they come from
                        Formlessness Itself. Forgiveness is an earthly form of love, which as it is
                        in Heaven has no form. Yet what is needed here is given here as it is
                        needed. In this form you can fulfill your function even here, although what
                        love will mean to you when formlessness has been restored to you is greater
                        still. Salvation of the world depends on you who can forgive. Such is your

                    <para>No one can give unless he has. In fact, giving is proof of having. We have
                        made this point before. What seems to make it hard to credit is not this. No
                        one can doubt that you must first possess what you would give. It is the
                        second phase on which the world and true perception differ. Having had and
                        given, then the world asserts that you have lost what you possessed. The
                        truth maintains that giving will increase what you possess.</para>
                    <para>How is this possible? For it is sure that if you give a finite thing away,
                        your body's eyes will not perceive it yours. Yet we have learned that things
                        but represent the thoughts that make them. And you do not lack for proof
                        that when you give ideas away, you strengthen them in your own mind. Perhaps
                        the form in which the thought seems to appear is changed in giving. Yet it
                        must return to him who gives. Nor can the form it takes be less acceptable.
                        It must be more.</para>
                    <para>Ideas must first belong to you, before you give them. If you are to save
                        the world, you first accept salvation for yourself. But you will not believe
                        that this is done until you see the miracles it brings to everyone you look
                        upon. Herein is the idea of giving clarified and given meaning. Now you can
                        perceive that by your giving is your store increased.</para>
                    <para>Protect all things you value by the act of giving them away, and you are
                        sure that you will never lose them. What you thought you did not have is
                        thereby proven yours. Yet value not its form. For this will change and grow
                        unrecognizable in time, however much you try to keep it safe. No form
                        endures. It is the thought behind the form of things that lives
                        unchangeable.</para>
                    <para>Give gladly. You can only gain thereby. The thought remains, and grows in
                        strength as it is reinforced by giving. Thoughts extend as they are shared,
                        for they can not be lost. There is no giver and receiver in the sense the
                        world conceives of them. There is a giver who retains; another who will give
                        as well. And both must gain in this exchange, for each will have the thought
                        in form most helpful to him. What he seems to lose is always something he
                        will value less than what will surely be returned to him.</para>
                    <para>Never forget you give but to yourself. Who understands what giving means
                        must laugh at the idea of sacrifice. Nor can he fail to recognize the many
                        forms which sacrifice may take. He laughs as well at pain and loss, at
                        sickness and at grief, at poverty, starvation and at death. He recognizes
                        sacrifice remains the one idea that stands behind them all, and in his
                        gentle laughter are they healed.</para>
                    <para>Illusion recognized must disappear. Accept not suffering, and you remove
                        the thought of suffering. Your blessing lies on everyone who suffers, when
                        you choose to see all suffering as what it is. The thought of sacrifice
                        gives rise to all the forms that suffering appears to take. And sacrifice is
                        an idea so mad that sanity dismisses it at once.</para>
                    <para>Never believe that you can sacrifice. There is no place for sacrifice in
                        what has any value. If the thought occurs, its very presence proves that
                        error has arisen and correction must be made. Your blessing will correct it.
                        Given first to you, it now is yours to give as well. No form of sacrifice
                        and suffering can long endure before the face of one who has forgiven and
                        has blessed himself.</para>
                    <para>The lilies that your brother offers you are laid upon your altar, with the
                        ones you offer him beside them. Who could fear to look upon such lovely
                        holiness? The great illusion of the fear of God diminishes to nothingness
                        before the purity that you will look on here. Be not afraid to look. The
                        blessedness you will behold will take away all thought of form, and leave
                        instead the perfect gift forever there, forever to increase, forever yours,
                        forever given away.</para>
                    <para>Now are we one in thought, for fear has gone. And here, before the altar
                        to one God, one Father, one Creator and one Thought, we stand together as
                        one Son of God. Not separate from Him Who is our Source; not distant from
                        one brother who is part of our one Self Whose innocence has joined us all as
                        one, we stand in blessedness, and give as we receive. The Name of God is on
                        our lips. And as we look within, we see the purity of Heaven shine in our
                        reflection of our Father's Love.</para>
                    <para>Now are we blessed, and now we bless the world. What we have looked upon
                        we would extend, for we would see it everywhere. We would behold it shining
                        with the grace of God in everyone. We would not have it be withheld from
                        anything we look upon. And to ensure this holy sight is ours, we offer it to
                        everything we see. For where we see it, it will be returned to us in form of
                        lilies we can lay upon our altar, making it a home for Innocence Itself, Who
                        dwells in us and offers us His Holiness as ours.</para>

                    <para>Why wait for Heaven? Those who seek the light are merely covering their
                        eyes. The light is in them now. Enlightenment is but a recognition, not a
                        change at all. Light is not of the world, yet you who bear the light in you
                        are alien here as well. The light came with you from your native home, and
                        stayed with you because it is your own. It is the only thing you bring with
                        you from Him Who is your Source. It shines in you because it lights your
                        home, and leads you back to where it came from and you are at home.</para>
                    <para>This light can not be lost. Why wait to find it in the future, or believe
                        it has been lost already, or was never there? It can so easily be looked
                        upon that arguments which prove it is not there become ridiculous. Who can
                        deny the presence of what he beholds in him? It is not difficult to look
                        within, for there all vision starts. There is no sight, be it of dreams or
                        from a truer Source, that is not but the shadow of the seen through inward
                        vision. There perception starts, and there it ends. It has no source but
                        this.</para>
                    <para>The peace of God is shining in you now, and from your heart extends around
                        the world. It pauses to caress each living thing, and leaves a blessing with
                        it that remains forever and forever. What it gives must be eternal. It
                        removes all thoughts of the ephemeral and valueless. It brings renewal to
                        all tired hearts, and lights all vision as it passes by. All of its gifts
                        are given everyone, and everyone unites in giving thanks to you who give,
                        and you who have received.</para>
                    <para>The shining in your mind reminds the world of what it has forgotten, and
                        the world restores the memory to you as well. From you salvation radiates
                        with gifts beyond all measure, given and returned. To you, the giver of the
                        gift, does God Himself give thanks. And in His blessing does the light in
                        you shine brighter, adding to the gifts you have to offer to the
                        world.</para>
                    <para>The peace of God can never be contained. Who recognizes it within himself
                        must give it. And the means for giving it are in his understanding. He
                        forgives because he recognized the truth in him. The peace of God is shining
                        in you now, and in all living things. In quietness is it acknowledged
                        universally. For what your inward vision looks upon is your perception of
                        the universe.</para>
                    <para>Sit quietly and close your eyes. The light within you is sufficient. It
                        alone has power to give the gift of sight to you. Exclude the outer world,
                        and let your thoughts fly to the peace within. They know the way. For honest
                        thoughts, untainted by the dream of worldly things outside yourself, become
                        the holy messengers of God Himself.</para>
                    <para>These thoughts you think with Him. They recognize their home. And they
                        point surely to their Source, Where God the Father and the Son are One.
                        God's peace is shining on them, but they must remain with you as well, for
                        they were born within your mind, as yours was born in God's. They lead you
                        back to peace, from where they came but to remind you how you must
                        return.</para>
                    <para>They heed your Father's Voice when you refuse to listen. And they urge you
                        gently to accept His Word for what you are, instead of fantasies and
                        shadows. They remind you that you are the co-creator of all things that
                        live. For as the peace of God is shining in you, it must shine on
                        them.</para>
                    <para>We practice coming nearer to the light in us today. We take our wandering
                        thoughts, and gently bring them back to where they fall in line with all the
                        thoughts we share with God. We will not let them stray. We let the light
                        within our minds direct them to come home. We have betrayed them, ordering
                        that they depart from us. But now we call them back, and wash them clean of
                        strange desires and disordered wishes. We restore to them the holiness of
                        their inheritance.</para>
                    <para>Thus are our minds restored with them, and we acknowledge that the peace
                        of God still shines in us, and from us to all living things that share our
                        life. We will forgive them all, absolving all the world from what we thought
                        it did to us. For it is we who make the world as we would have it. Now we
                        choose that it be innocent, devoid of sin and open to salvation. And we lay
                        our saving blessing on it, as we say:</para>

                    <para>There is a light in you the world can not perceive. And with its eyes you
                        will not see this light, for you are blinded by the world. Yet you have eyes
                        to see it. It is there for you to look upon. It was not placed in you to be
                        kept hidden from your sight. This light is a reflection of the thought we
                        practice now. To feel the Love of God within you is to see the world anew,
                        shining in innocence, alive with hope, and blessed with perfect charity and
                        love.</para>
                    <para>Who could feel fear in such a world as this? It welcomes you, rejoices
                        that you came, and sings your praises as it keeps you safe from every form
                        of danger and of pain. It offers you a warm and gentle home in which to stay
                        a while. It blesses you throughout the day, and watches through the night as
                        silent guardian of your holy sleep. It sees salvation in you, and protects
                        the light in you, in which it sees its own. It offers you its flowers and
                        its snow, in thankfulness for your benevolence.</para>
                    <para>This is the world the Love of God reveals. It is so different from the
                        world you see through darkened eyes of malice and of fear, that one belies
                        the other. Only one can be perceived at all. The other one is wholly
                        meaningless. A world in which forgiveness shines on everything, and peace
                        offers its gentle light to everyone, is inconceivable to those who see a
                        world of hatred rising from attack, poised to avenge, to murder and
                        destroy.</para>
                    <para>Yet is the world of hatred equally unseen and inconceivable to those who
                        feel God's Love in them. Their world reflects the quietness and peace that
                        shines in them; the gentleness and innocence they see surrounding them; the
                        joy with which they look out from the endless wells of joy within. What they
                        have felt in them they look upon, and see its sure reflection
                        everywhere.</para>
                    <para>What would you see? The choice is given you. But learn and do not let your
                        mind forget this law of seeing: You will look upon that which you feel
                        within. If hatred finds a place within your heart, you will perceive a
                        fearful world, held cruelly in death's sharp-pointed, bony fingers. If you
                        feel the Love of God within you, you will look out on a world of mercy and
                        of love.</para>
                    <para>Today we pass illusions, as we seek to reach to what is true in us, and
                        feel its all-embracing tenderness, its Love which knows us perfect as
                        itself, its sight which is the gift its Love bestows on us. We learn the way
                        today. It is as sure as Love itself, to which it carries us. For its
                        simplicity avoids the snares the foolish convolutions of the world's
                        apparent reasoning but serve to hide.</para>
                    <para>Simply do this: Be still, and lay aside all thoughts of what you are and
                        what God is; all concepts you have learned about the world; all images you
                        hold about yourself. Empty your mind of everything it thinks is either true
                        or false, or good or bad, of every thought it judges worthy, and all the
                        ideas of which it is ashamed. Hold onto nothing. Do not bring with you one
                        thought the past has taught, nor one belief you ever learned before from
                        anything. Forget this world, forget this course, and come with wholly empty
                        hands unto your God.</para>
                    <para>Is it not He Who knows the way to you? You need not know the way to Him.
                        Your part is simply to allow all obstacles that you have interposed between
                        the Son and God the Father to be quietly removed forever. God will do His
                        part in joyful and immediate response. Ask and receive. But do not make
                        demands, nor point the road to God by which He should appear to you. The way
                        to reach Him is merely to let Him be. For in that way is your reality
                        proclaimed as well.</para>
                    <para>And so today we do not choose the way in which we go to Him. But we do
                        choose to let Him come. And with this choice we rest. And in our quiet
                        hearts and open minds, His Love will blaze its pathway of itself. What has
                        not been denied is surely there, if it be true and can be surely reached.
                        God knows His Son, and knows the way to him. He does not need His Son to
                        show Him how to find His way. Through every opened door His Love shines
                        outward from its home within, and lightens up the world in innocence.</para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>Father, we do not know the way to You. But we
                                have called, and You have answered us. We will not interfere.
                                Salvation's ways are not our own, for they belong to You. And it is
                                unto You we look for them. Our hands are open to receive Your gifts.
                                We have no thoughts we think apart from You, and cherish no beliefs
                                of what we are, or Who created us. Yours is the way that we would
                                find and follow. And we ask but that Your Will, which is our own as
                                well, be done in us and in the world, that it become a part of
                                Heaven now. Amen.</para>

                    <para>Pain is a wrong perspective. When it is experienced in any form, it is a
                        proof of self-deception. It is not a fact at all. There is no form it takes
                        that will not disappear if seen aright. For pain proclaims God cruel. How
                        could it be real in any form? It witnesses to God the Father's hatred of His
                        Son, the sinfulness He sees in him, and His insane desire for revenge and
                        death.</para>
                    <para>Can such projections be attested to? Can they be anything but wholly
                        false? Pain is but witness to the Son's mistakes in what he thinks he is. It
                        is a dream of fierce retaliation for a crime that could not be committed;
                        for attack on what is wholly unassailable. It is a nightmare of abandonment
                        by an Eternal Love, which could not leave the Son whom It created out of
                        love.</para>
                    <para>Pain is a sign illusions reign in place of truth. It demonstrates God is
                        denied, confused with fear, perceived as mad, and seen as traitor to
                        Himself. If God is real, there is no pain. If pain is real, there is no God.
                        For vengeance is not part of love. And fear, denying love and using pain to
                        prove that God is dead, has shown that death is victor over life. The body
                        is the Son of God, corruptible in death, as mortal as the Father he has
                        slain.</para>
                    <para>Peace to such foolishness! The time has come to laugh at such insane
                        ideas. There is no need to think of them as savage crimes, or secret sins
                        with weighty consequence. Who but a madman could conceive of them as cause
                        of anything? Their witness, pain, is mad as they, and no more to be feared
                        than the insane illusions which it shields, and tries to demonstrate must
                        still be true.</para>
                    <para>It is your thoughts alone that cause you pain. Nothing external to your
                        mind can hurt or injure you in any way. There is no cause beyond yourself
                        that can reach down and bring oppression. No one but yourself affects you.
                        There is nothing in the world that has the power to make you ill or sad, or
                        weak or frail. But it is you who have the power to dominate all things you
                        see by merely recognizing what you are. As you perceive the harmlessness in
                        them, they will accept your holy will as theirs. And what was seen as
                        fearful now becomes a source of innocence and holiness.</para>
                    <para>My holy brother, think of this awhile: The world you see does nothing. It
                        has no effects at all. It merely represents your thoughts. And it will
                        change entirely as you elect to change your mind, and choose the joy of God
                        as what you really want. Your Self is radiant in this holy joy, unchanged,
                        unchanging and unchangeable, forever and forever. And would you deny a
                        little corner of your mind its own inheritance, and keep it as a hospital
                        for pain; a sickly place where living things must come at last to
                        die?</para>
                    <para>The world may seem to cause you pain. And yet the world, as causeless, has
                        no power to cause. As an effect, it cannot make effects. As an illusion, it
                        is what you wish. Your idle wishes represent its pains. Your strange desires
                        bring it evil dreams. Your thoughts of death envelop it in fear, while in
                        your kind forgiveness does it live.</para>
                    <para>Pain is the thought of evil taking form, and working havoc in your holy
                        mind. Pain is the ransom you have gladly paid not to be free. In pain is God
                        denied the Son He loves. In pain does fear appear to triumph over love, and
                        time replace eternity and Heaven. And the world becomes a cruel and a bitter
                        place, where sorrow rules and little joys give way before the onslaught of
                        the savage pain that waits to end all joy in misery.</para>
                    <para>Lay down your arms, and come without defense into the quiet place where
                        Heaven's peace holds all things still at last. Lay down all thoughts of
                        danger and of fear. Let no attack enter with you. Lay down the cruel sword
                        of judgment that you hold against your throat, and put aside the withering
                        assaults with which you seek to hide your holiness.</para>
                    <para>Here will you understand there is no pain. Here does the joy of God belong
                        to you. This is the day when it is given you to realize the lesson that
                        contains all of salvation's power. It is this: Pain is illusion; joy,
                        reality. Pain is but sleep; joy is awakening. Pain is deception; joy alone
                        is truth.</para>
                    <para>And so again we make the only choice that ever can be made; we choose
                        between illusions and the truth, or pain and joy, or hell and Heaven. Let
                        our gratitude unto our Teacher fill our hearts, as we are free to choose our
                        joy instead of pain, our holiness in place of sin, the peace of God instead
                        of conflict, and the light of Heaven for the darkness of the world.</para>

                        well is all the world released. You do not see what you have done by giving
                        to the world the role of jailer to the Son of God. What could it be but
                        vicious and afraid, fearful of shadows, punitive and wild, lacking all
                        reason, blind, insane with hate?</para>
                    <para>What have you done that this should be your world? What have you done that
                        this is what you see? Deny your own Identity, and this is what remains. You
                        look on chaos and proclaim it is yourself. There is no sight that fails to
                        witness this to you. There is no sound that does not speak of frailty within
                        you and without; no breath you draw that does not seem to bring you nearer
                        death; no hope you hold but will dissolve in tears.</para>
                    <para>Deny your own Identity, and you will not escape the madness which induced
                        this weird, unnatural and ghostly thought that mocks creation and that
                        laughs at God. Deny your own Identity, and you assail the universe alone,
                        without a friend, a tiny particle of dust against the legions of your
                        enemies. Deny your own Identity, and look on evil, sin and death, and watch
                        despair snatch from your fingers every scrap of hope, leaving you nothing
                        but the wish to die.</para>
                    <para>Yet what is it except a game you play in which Identity can be denied? You
                        are as God created you. All else but this one thing is folly to believe. In
                        this one thought is everyone set free. In this one truth are all illusions
                        gone. In this one fact is sinlessness proclaimed to be forever part of
                        everything, the central core of its existence and its guarantee of
                        immortality.</para>
                    <para>But let today's idea find a place among your thoughts and you have risen
                        far above the world, and all the worldly thoughts that hold it prisoner. And
                        from this place of safety and escape you will return and set it free. For he
                        who can accept his true Identity is truly saved. And his salvation is the
                        gift he gives to everyone, in gratitude to Him Who pointed out the way to
                        happiness that changed his whole perspective of the world.</para>
                    <para>One holy thought like this and you are free: You are the holy Son of God
                        Himself. And with this holy thought you learn as well that you have freed
                        the world. You have no need to use it cruelly, and then perceive this savage
                        need in it. You set it free of your imprisonment. You will not see a
                        devastating image of yourself walking the world in terror, with the world
                        twisting in agony because your fears have laid the mark of death upon its
                        heart.</para>
                    <para>Be glad today how very easily is hell undone. You need but tell
                        yourself:</para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>I am the holy Son of God Himself. I cannot
                                suffer, cannot be in pain; I cannot suffer loss, nor fail to do all
                                that salvation asks.</para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>And in that thought is everything you look on wholly changed.</para>
                    <para>A miracle has lighted up all dark and ancient caverns, where the rites of
                        death echoed since time began. For time has lost its hold upon the world.
                        The Son of God has come in glory to redeem the lost, to save the helpless,
                        and to give the world the gift of his forgiveness. Who could see the world
                        as dark and sinful, when God's Son has come again at last to set it
                        free?</para>
                    <para>You who perceive yourself as weak and frail, with futile hopes and
                        devastated dreams, born but to die, to weep and suffer pain, hear this: All
                        power is given unto you in earth and Heaven. There is nothing that you
                        cannot do. You play the game of death, of being helpless, pitifully tied to
                        dissolution in a world which shows no mercy to you. Yet when you accord it
                        mercy, will its mercy shine on you.</para>
                    <para>Then let the Son of God awaken from his sleep, and opening his holy eyes,
                        return again to bless the world he made. In error it began, but it will end
                        in the reflection of his holiness. And he will sleep no more and dream of
                        death. Then join with me today. Your glory is the light that saves the
                        world. Do not withhold salvation longer. Look about the world, and see the
                        suffering there. Is not your heart willing to bring your weary brothers
                        rest?</para>
                    <para>They must await your own release. They stay in chains till you are free.
                        They cannot see the mercy of the world until you find it in yourself. They
                        suffer pain until you have denied its hold on you. They die till you accept
                        your own eternal life. You are the holy Son of God Himself. Remember this,
                        and all the world is free. Remember this, and earth and Heaven are
                        one.</para>

                    <para>It is your Father's holy Will that you complete Himself, and that your
                        Self shall be His sacred Son, forever pure as He, of love created and in
                        love preserved, extending love, creating in its name, forever one with God
                        and with your Self. Yet what can such a function mean within a world of
                        envy, hatred and attack?</para>
                    <para>Therefore, you have a function in the world in its own terms. For who can
                        understand a language far beyond his simple grasp? Forgiveness represents
                        your function here. It is not God's creation, for it is the means by which
                        untruth can be undone. And who would pardon Heaven? Yet on earth, you need
                        the means to let illusions go. Creation merely waits for your return to be
                        acknowledged, not to be complete.</para>
                    <para>Creation cannot even be conceived of in the world. It has no meaning here.
                        Forgiveness is the closest it can come to earth. For being Heaven-born, it
                        has no form at all. Yet God created One Who has the power to translate in
                        form the wholly formless. What He makes are dreams, but of a kind so close
                        to waking that the light of day already shines in them, and eyes already
                        opening behold the joyful sights their offerings contain.</para>
                    <para>Forgiveness gently looks upon all things unknown in Heaven, sees them
                        disappear, and leaves the world a clean and unmarked slate on which the Word
                        of God can now replace the senseless symbols written there before.
                        Forgiveness is the means by which the fear of death is overcome, because it
                        holds no fierce attraction now and guilt is gone. Forgiveness lets the body
                        be perceived as what it is; a simple teaching aid, to be laid by when
                        learning is complete, but hardly changing him who learns at all.</para>
                    <para>The mind without the body cannot make mistakes. It cannot think that it
                        will die, nor be the prey of merciless attack. Anger becomes impossible, and
                        where is terror then? What fears could still assail those who have lost the
                        source of all attack, the core of anguish and the seat of fear? Only
                        forgiveness can relieve the mind of thinking that the body is its home. Only
                        forgiveness can restore the peace that God intended for His holy Son. Only
                        forgiveness can persuade the Son to look again upon his holiness.</para>
                    <para>With anger gone, you will indeed perceive that, for Christ's vision and
                        the gift of sight, no sacrifice was asked, and only pain was lifted from a
                        sick and tortured mind. Is this unwelcome? Is it to be feared? Or is it to
                        be hoped for, met with thanks and joyously accepted? We are one, and
                        therefore give up nothing. But we have indeed been given everything by
                        God.</para>
                    <para>Yet do we need forgiveness to perceive that this is so. Without its kindly
                        light we grope in darkness, using reason but to justify our rage and our
                        attack. Our understanding is so limited that what we think we understand is
                        but confusion born of error. We are lost in mists of shifting dreams and
                        fearful thoughts, our eyes shut tight against the light; our minds engaged
                        in worshipping what is not there.</para>
                    <para>Who can be born again in Christ but him who has forgiven everyone he sees
                        or thinks of or imagines? Who could be set free while he imprisons anyone? A
                        jailer is not free, for he is bound together with his prisoner. He must be
                        sure that he does not escape, and so he spends his time in keeping watch on
                        him. The bars that limit him become the world in which his jailer lives,
                        along with him. And it is on his freedom that the way to liberty depends for
                        both of them.</para>
                    <para>Therefore, hold no one prisoner. Release instead of bind, for thus are you
                        made free. The way is simple. Every time you feel a stab of anger, realize
                        you hold a sword above your head. And it will fall or be averted as you
                        choose to be condemned or free. Thus does each one who seems to tempt you to
                        be angry represent your savior from the prison house of death. And so you
                        owe him thanks instead of pain.</para>
                    <para>Be merciful today. The Son of God deserves your mercy. It is he who asks
                        that you accept the way to freedom now. Deny him not. His Father's Love for
                        him belongs to you. Your function here on earth is only to forgive him, that
                        you may accept him back as your Identity. He is as God created him. And you
                        are what he is. Forgive him now his sins, and you will see that you are one
                        with him.</para>

                    <para>God does not know of learning. Yet His Will extends to what He does not
                        understand, in that He wills the happiness His Son inherited of Him be
                        undisturbed; eternal and forever gaining scope, eternally expanding in the
                        joy of full creation, and eternally open and wholly limitless in Him. That
                        is His Will. And thus His Will provides the means to guarantee that it is
                        done.</para>
                    <para>God sees no contradictions. Yet His Son believes he sees them. Thus he has
                        a need for One Who can correct his erring sight, and give him vision that
                        will lead him back to where perception ceases. God does not perceive at all.
                        Yet it is He Who gives the means by which perception is made true and
                        beautiful enough to let the light of Heaven shine upon it. It is He Who
                        answers what His Son would contradict, and keeps his sinlessness forever
                        safe.</para>
                    <para>These are the lessons God would have you learn. His Will reflects them
                        all, and they reflect His loving kindness to the Son He loves. Each lesson
                        has a central thought, the same in all of them. The form alone is changed,
                        with different circumstances and events; with different characters and
                        different themes, apparent but not real. They are the same in fundamental
                        content. It is this:</para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>Forgive, and you will see this                                differently.</para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Certain it is that all distress does not appear to be but unforgiveness.
                        Yet that is the content underneath the form. It is this sameness which makes
                        learning sure, because the lesson is so simple that it cannot be rejected in
                        the end. No one can hide forever from a truth so very obvious that it
                        appears in countless forms, and yet is recognized as easily in all of them,
                        if one but wants to see the simple lesson there.</para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>Forgive, and you will see this                                differently.</para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>These are the words the Holy Spirit speaks in all your tribulations, all
                        your pain, all suffering regardless of its form. These are the words with
                        which temptation ends, and guilt, abandoned, is revered no more. These are
                        the words which end the dream of sin, and rid the mind of fear. These are
                        the words by which salvation comes to all the world.</para>
                    <para>Shall we not learn to say these words when we are tempted to believe that
                        pain is real, and death becomes our choice instead of life? Shall we not
                        learn to say these words when we have understood their power to release all
                        minds from bondage? These are words which give you power over all events
                        that seem to have been given power over you. You see them rightly when you
                        hold these words in full awareness, and do not forget these words apply to
                        everything you see or any brother looks upon amiss.</para>
                    <para>How can you tell when you are seeing wrong, or someone else is failing to
                        perceive the lesson he should learn? Does pain seem real in the perception?
                        If it does, be sure the lesson is not learned. And there remains an
                        unforgiveness hiding in the mind that sees the pain through eyes the mind
                        directs.</para>
                    <para>God would not have you suffer thus. He would help you forgive yourself.
                        His Son does not remember who he is. And God would have him not forget His
                        Love, and all the gifts His Love brings with it. Would you now renounce your
                        own salvation? Would you fail to learn the simple lessons Heaven's Teacher
                        sets before you, that all pain may disappear and God may be remembered by
                        His Son?</para>
                    <para>All things are lessons God would have you learn. He would not leave an
                        unforgiving thought without correction, nor one thorn or nail to hurt His
                        holy Son in any way. He would ensure his holy rest remain untroubled and
                        serene, without a care, in an eternal home which cares for him. And He would
                        have all tears be wiped away, with none remaining yet unshed, and none but
                        waiting their appointed time to fall. For God has willed that laughter
                        should replace each one, and that His Son be free again.</para>
                    <para>We will attempt today to overcome a thousand seeming obstacles to peace in
                        just one day. Let mercy come to you more quickly. Do not try to hold it off
                        another day, another minute or another instant. Time was made for this. Use
                        it today for what its purpose is. Morning and night, devote what time you
                        can to serve its proper aim, and do not let the time be less than meets your
                        deepest need.</para>
                    <para>Give all you can, and give a little more. For now we would arise in haste
                        and go unto our Father's house. We have been gone too long, and we would
                        linger here no more. And as we practice, let us think about all things we
                        saved to settle by ourselves, and kept apart from healing. Let us give them
                        all to Him Who knows the way to look upon them so that they will disappear.
                        Truth is His message; truth His teaching is. His are the lessons God would
                        have us learn.</para>
                    <para>Each hour, spend a little time today, and in the days to come, in
                        practicing the lesson in forgiveness in the form established for the day.
                        And try to give it application to the happenings the hour brought, so that
                        the next one is free of the one before. The chains of time are easily
                        unloosened in this way. Let no one hour cast its shadow on the one that
                        follows, and when that one goes, let everything that happened in its course
                        go with it. Thus will you remain unbound, in peace eternal in the world of
                        time.</para>
                    <para>This is the lesson God would have you learn: There is a way to look on
                        everything that lets it be to you another step to Him, and to salvation of
                        the world. To all that speaks of terror, answer thus:</para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>I will forgive, and this will                                disappear.</para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>To every apprehension, every care and every form of suffering, repeat
                        these selfsame words. And then you hold the key that opens Heaven's gate,
                        and brings the Love of God the Father down to earth at last, to raise it up
                        to Heaven. God will take this final step Himself. Do not deny the little
                        steps He asks you take to Him.</para>

                    <para>Today's idea takes another step toward quick salvation, and a giant stride
                        it is indeed! So great the distance is that it encompasses, it sets you down
                        just short of Heaven, with the goal in sight and obstacles behind. Your foot
                        has reached the lawns that welcome you to Heaven's gate; the quiet place of
                        peace, where you await with certainty the final step of God. How far are we
                        progressing now from earth! How close are we approaching to our goal! How
                        short the journey still to be pursued!</para>
                    <para>Accept today's idea, and you have passed all anxiety, all pits of hell,
                        all blackness of depression, thoughts of sin, and devastation brought about
                        by guilt. Accept today's idea, and you have released the world from all
                        imprisonment by loosening the heavy chains that locked the door to freedom
                        on it. You are saved, and your salvation thus becomes the gift you give the
                        world, because you have received.</para>
                    <para>In no one instant is depression felt, or pain experienced or loss
                        perceived. In no one instant sorrow can be set upon a throne, and worshipped
                        faithfully. In no one instant can one even die. And so each instant given
                        unto God in passing, with the next one given Him already, is a time of your
                        release from sadness, pain and even death itself.</para>
                    <para>God holds your future as He holds your past and present. They are one to
                        Him, and so they should be one to you. Yet in this world, the temporal
                        progression still seems real. And so you are not asked to understand the
                        lack of sequence really found in time. You are but asked to let the future
                        go, and place it in God's Hands. And you will see by your experience that
                        you have laid the past and present in His Hands as well, because the past
                        will punish you no more, and future dread will now be meaningless.</para>
                    <para>Release the future. For the past is gone, and what is present, freed from
                        its bequest of grief and misery, of pain and loss, becomes the instant in
                        which time escapes the bondage of illusions where it runs its pitiless,
                        inevitable course. Then is each instant which was slave to time transformed
                        into a holy instant, when the light that was kept hidden in God's Son is
                        freed to bless the world. Now is he free, and all his glory shines upon a
                        world made free with him, to share his holiness.</para>
                    <para>If you can see the lesson for today as the deliverance it really is, you
                        will not hesitate to give as much consistent effort as you can, to make it
                        be a part of you. As it becomes a thought that rules your mind, a habit in
                        your problem-solving repertoire, a way of quick reaction to temptation, you
                        extend your learning to the world. And as you learn to see salvation in all
                        things, so will the world perceive that it is saved.</para>
                    <para>What worry can beset the one who gives his future to the loving Hands of
                        God? What can he suffer? What can cause him pain, or bring experience of
                        loss to him? What can he fear? And what can he regard except with love? For
                        he who has escaped all fear of future pain has found his way to present
                        peace, and certainty of care the world can never threaten. He is sure that
                        his perception may be faulty, but will never lack correction. He is free to
                        choose again when he has been deceived; to change his mind when he has made
                        mistakes.</para>
                    <para>Place, then, your future in the Hands of God. For thus you call the memory
                        of Him to come again, replacing all your thoughts of sin and evil with the
                        truth of love. Think you the world could fail to gain thereby, and every
                        living creature not respond with healed perception? Who entrusts himself to
                        God has also placed the world within the Hands to which he has himself
                        appealed for comfort and security. He lays aside the sick illusions of the
                        world along with his, and offers peace to both.</para>
                    <para>Now are we saved indeed. For in God's Hands we rest untroubled, sure that
                        only good can come to us. If we forget, we will be gently reassured. If we
                        accept an unforgiving thought, it will be soon replaced by love's
                        reflection. And if we are tempted to attack, we will appeal to Him Who
                        guards our rest to make the choice for us that leaves temptation far behind.
                        No longer is the world our enemy, for we have chosen that we be its
                        friend.</para>

                    <para>Gratitude is a lesson hard to learn for those who look upon the world
                        amiss. The most that they can do is see themselves as better off than
                        others. And they try to be content because another seems to suffer more than
                        they. How pitiful and deprecating are such thoughts! For who has cause for
                        thanks while others have less cause? And who could suffer less because he
                        sees another suffer more? Your gratitude is due to Him alone Who made all
                        cause of sorrow disappear throughout the world.</para>
                    <para>It is insane to offer thanks because of suffering. But it is equally
                        insane to fail in gratitude to One Who offers you the certain means whereby
                        all pain is healed, and suffering replaced with laughter and with happiness.
                        Nor could the even partly sane refuse to take the steps which He directs,
                        and follow in the way He sets before them, to escape a prison that they
                        thought contained no door to the deliverance they now perceive.</para>
                    <para>Your brother is your "enemy" because you see in him the rival for your
                        peace; a plunderer who takes his joy from you, and leaves you nothing but a
                        black despair so bitter and relentless that there is no hope remaining. Now
                        is vengeance all there is to wish for. Now can you but try to bring him down
                        to lie in death with you, as useless as yourself; as little left within his
                        grasping fingers as in yours.</para>
                    <para>You do not offer God your gratitude because your brother is more slave
                        than you, nor could you sanely be enraged if he seems freer. Love makes no
                        comparisons. And gratitude can only be sincere if it be joined to love. We
                        offer thanks to God our Father that in us all things will find their
                        freedom. It will never be that some are loosed while others still are bound.
                        For who can bargain in the name of love?</para>
                    <para>Therefore give thanks, but in sincerity. And let your gratitude make room
                        for all who will escape with you; the sick, the weak, the needy and afraid,
                        and those who mourn a seeming loss or feel apparent pain, who suffer cold or
                        hunger, or who walk the way of hatred and the path of death. All these go
                        with you. Let us not compare ourselves with them, for thus we split them off
                        from our awareness of the unity we share with them, as they must share with
                        us.</para>
                    <para>We thank our Father for one thing alone; that we are separate from no
                        living thing, and therefore one with Him. And we rejoice that no exceptions
                        ever can be made which would reduce our wholeness, nor impair or change our
                        function to complete the One Who is Himself completion. We give thanks for
                        every living thing, for otherwise we offer thanks for nothing, and we fail
                        to recognize the gifts of God to us.</para>
                    <para>Then let our brothers lean their tired heads against our shoulders as they
                        rest a while. We offer thanks for them. For if we can direct them to the
                        peace that we would find, the way is opening at last to us. An ancient door
                        is swinging free again; a long forgotten Word re-echoes in our memory, and
                        gathers clarity as we are willing once again to hear.</para>
                    <para>Walk, then, in gratitude the way of love. For hatred is forgotten when we
                        lay comparisons aside. What more remains as obstacles to peace? The fear of
                        God is now undone at last, and we forgive without comparing. Thus we cannot
                        choose to overlook some things, and yet retain some other things still
                        locked away as "sins." When your forgiveness is complete you will have total
                        gratitude, for you will see that everything has earned the right to love by
                        being loving, even as your Self.</para>
                    <para>Today we learn to think of gratitude in place of anger, malice and
                        revenge. We have been given everything. If we refuse to recognize it, we are
                        not entitled therefore to our bitterness, and to a self-perception which
                        regards us in a place of merciless pursuit, where we are badgered
                        ceaselessly, and pushed about without a thought or care for us or for our
                        future. Gratitude becomes the single thought we substitute for these insane
                        perceptions. God has cared for us, and calls us Son. Can there be more than
                        this?</para>
                    <para>Our gratitude will pave the way to Him, and shorten our learning time by
                        more than you could ever dream of. Gratitude goes hand in hand with love,
                        and where one is the other must be found. For gratitude is but an aspect of
                        the Love which is the Source of all creation. God gives thanks to you, His
                        Son, for being what you are; His Own completion and the Source of love,
                        along with Him. Your gratitude to Him is one with His to you. For love can
                        walk no road except the way of gratitude, and thus we go who walk the way to
                        God.</para>

                    <para>When this is firmly understood and kept in full awareness, you will not
                        attempt to harm yourself, nor make your body slave to vengeance. You will
                        not attack yourself, and you will realize that to attack another is but to
                        attack yourself. You will be free of the insane belief that to attack a
                        brother saves yourself. And you will understand his safety is your own, and
                        in his healing you are healed.</para>
                    <para>Perhaps at first you will not understand how mercy, limitless and with all
                        things held in its sure protection, can be found in the idea we practice for
                        today. It may, in fact, appear to be a sign that punishment can never be
                        escaped because the ego, under what it sees as threat, is quick to cite the
                        truth to save its lies. Yet must it fail to understand the truth it uses
                        thus. But you can learn to see these foolish applications, and deny the
                        meaning they appear to have.</para>
                    <para>Thus do you also teach your mind that you are not an ego. For the ways in
                        which the ego would distort the truth will not deceive you longer. You will
                        not believe you are a body to be crucified. And you will see within today's
                        idea the light of resurrection, looking past all thoughts of crucifixion and
                        of death, to thoughts of liberation and of life.</para>
                    <para>Today's idea is one step we take in leading us from bondage to the state
                        of perfect freedom. Let us take this step today, that we may quickly go the
                        way salvation shows us, taking every step in its appointed sequence, as the
                        mind relinquishes its burdens one by one. It is not time we need for this.
                        It is but willingness. For what would seem to need a thousand years can
                        easily be done in just one instant by the grace of God.</para>
                    <para>The dreary, hopeless thought that you can make attacks on others and
                        escape yourself has nailed you to the cross. Perhaps it seemed to be
                        salvation. Yet it merely stood for the belief the fear of God is real. And
                        what is that but hell? Who could believe his Father is his deadly enemy,
                        separate from him, and waiting to destroy his life and blot him from the
                        universe, without the fear of hell upon his heart?</para>
                    <para>Such is the form of madness you believe, if you accept the fearful thought
                        you can attack another and be free yourself. Until this form is changed,
                        there is no hope. Until you see that this, at least, must be entirely
                        impossible, how could there be escape? The fear of God is real to anyone who
                        thinks this thought is true. And he will not perceive its foolishness, or
                        even see that it is there, so that it would be possible to question
                        it.</para>
                    <para>To question it at all, its form must first be changed at least as much as
                        will permit fear of retaliation to abate, and the responsibility returned to
                        some extent to you. From there you can at least consider if you want to go
                        along this painful path. Until this shift has been accomplished, you can not
                        perceive that it is but your thoughts that bring you fear, and your
                        deliverance depends on you.</para>
                    <para>Our next steps will be easy, if you take this one today. From there we go
                        ahead quite rapidly. For once you understand it is impossible that you be
                        hurt except by your own thoughts, the fear of God must disappear. You cannot
                        then believe that fear is caused without. And God, Whom you had thought to
                        banish, can be welcomed back within the holy mind He never left.</para>
                    <para>Salvation's song can certainly be heard in the idea we practice for today.
                        If it can but be you you crucify, you did not hurt the world, and need not
                        fear its vengeance and pursuit. Nor need you hide in terror from the deadly
                        fear of God projection hides behind. The thing you dread the most is your
                        salvation. You are strong, and it is strength you want. And you are free,
                        and glad of freedom. You have sought to be both weak and bound, because you
                        feared your strength and freedom. Yet salvation lies in them.</para>
                    <para>There is an instant in which terror seems to grip your mind so wholly that
                        escape appears quite hopeless. When you realize, once and for all, that it
                        is you you fear, the mind perceives itself as split. And this had been
                        concealed while you believed attack could be directed outward, and returned
                        from outside to within. It seemed to be an enemy outside you had to fear.
                        And thus a god outside yourself became your mortal enemy; the source of
                        fear.</para>
                    <para>Now, for an instant, is a murderer perceived within you, eager for your
                        death, intent on plotting punishment for you until the time when it can kill
                        at last. Yet in this instant is the time as well in which salvation comes.
                        For fear of God has disappeared. And you can call on Him to save you from
                        illusions by His Love, calling Him Father and yourself His Son. Pray that
                        the instant may be soon,--today. Step back from fear, and make advance to
                        love.</para>
                    <para>There is no Thought of God that does not go with you to help you reach
                        that instant, and to go beyond it quickly, surely and forever. When the fear
                        of God is gone, there are no obstacles that still remain between you and the
                        holy peace of God. How kind and merciful is the idea we practice! Give it
                        welcome, as you should, for it is your release. It is indeed but you your
                        mind can try to crucify. Yet your redemption, too, will come from
                        you.</para>

                    <para>Here is the second step we take to free your mind from the belief in
                        outside force pitted against your own. You make attempts at kindness and
                        forgiveness. Yet you turn them to attack again, unless you find external
                        gratitude and lavish thanks. Your gifts must be received with honor, lest
                        they be withdrawn. And so you think God's gifts are loans at best; at worst,
                        deceptions which would cheat you of defenses, to ensure that when He strikes
                        He will not fail to kill.</para>
                    <para>How easily are God and guilt confused by those who know not what their
                        thoughts can do. Deny your strength, and weakness must become salvation to
                        you. See yourself as bound, and bars become your home. Nor will you leave
                        the prison house, or claim your strength, until guilt and salvation are not
                        seen as one, and freedom and salvation are perceived as joined, with
                        strength beside them, to be sought and claimed, and found and fully
                        recognized.</para>
                    <para>The world must thank you when you offer it release from your illusions.
                        Yet your thanks belong to you as well, for its release can only mirror
                        yours. Your gratitude is all your gifts require, that they be a lasting
                        offering of a thankful heart, released from hell forever. Is it this you
                        would undo by taking back your gifts, because they were not honored? It is
                        you who honor them and give them fitting thanks, for it is you who have
                        received the gifts.</para>
                    <para>It does not matter if another thinks your gifts unworthy. In his mind
                        there is a part that joins with yours in thanking you. It does not matter if
                        your gifts seem lost and ineffectual. They are received where they are
                        given. In your gratitude are they accepted universally, and thankfully
                        acknowledged by the Heart of God Himself. And would you take them back, when
                        He has gratefully accepted them?</para>
                    <para>God blesses every gift you give to Him, and every gift is given Him,
                        because it can be given only to yourself. And what belongs to God must be
                        His Own. Yet you will never realize His gifts are sure, eternal, changeless,
                        limitless, forever giving out, extending love and adding to your neverending
                        joy while you forgive but to attack again.</para>
                    <para>Withdraw the gifts you give, and you will think that what is given you has
                        been withdrawn. But learn to let forgiveness take away the sins you think
                        you see outside yourself, and you can never think the gifts of God are lent
                        but for a little while, before He snatches them away again in death. For
                        death will have no meaning for you then.</para>
                    <para>And with the end of this belief is fear forever over. Thank your Self for
                        this, for He is grateful only unto God, and He gives thanks for you unto
                        Himself. To everyone who lives will Christ yet come, for everyone must live
                        and move in Him. His Being in His Father is secure, because Their Will is
                        One. Their gratitude to all They have created has no end, for gratitude
                        remains a part of love.</para>
                    <para>Thanks be to you, the holy Son of God. For as you were created, you
                        contain all things within your Self. And you are still as God created you.
                        Nor can you dim the light of your perfection. In your heart the Heart of God
                        is laid. He holds you dear, because you are Himself. All gratitude belongs
                        to you, because of what you are.</para>
                    <para>Give thanks as you receive it. Be you free of all ingratitude to anyone
                        who makes your Self complete. And from this Self is no one left outside.
                        Give thanks for all the countless channels which extend this Self. All that
                        you do is given unto Him. All that you think can only be His Thoughts,
                        sharing with Him the holy Thoughts of God. Earn now the gratitude you have
                        denied yourself when you forgot the function God has given you. But never
                        think that He has ever ceased to offer thanks to you.</para>

                        effects, and those it seemed to have will be undone. Then are you free, for
                        freedom is your gift, and you can now receive the gift you gave.</para>
                    <para>Condemn and you are made a prisoner. Forgive and you are freed. Such is
                        the law that rules perception. It is not a law that knowledge understands,
                        for freedom is a part of knowledge. To condemn is thus impossible in truth.
                        What seems to be its influence and its effects have not occurred at all. Yet
                        must we deal with them a while as if they had. Illusion makes illusion.
                        Except one. Forgiveness is illusion that is answer to the rest.</para>
                    <para>Forgiveness sweeps all other dreams away, and though it is itself a dream,
                        it breeds no others. All illusions save this one must multiply a
                        thousandfold. But this is where illusions end. Forgiveness is the end of
                        dreams, because it is a dream of waking. It is not itself the truth. Yet
                        does it point to where the truth must be, and gives direction with the
                        certainty of God Himself. It is a dream in which the Son of God awakens to
                        his Self and to his Father, knowing They are One.</para>
                    <para>Forgiveness is the only road that leads out of disaster, past all
                        suffering, and finally away from death. How could there be another way, when
                        this one is the plan of God Himself? And why would you oppose it, quarrel
                        with it, seek to find a thousand ways in which it must be wrong; a thousand
                        other possibilities?</para>
                    <para>Is it not wiser to be glad you hold the answer to your problems in your
                        hand? Is it not more intelligent to thank the One Who gives salvation, and
                        accept His gift with gratitude? And is it not a kindness to yourself to hear
                        His Voice and learn the simple lessons He would teach, instead of trying to
                        dismiss His words, and substitute your own in place of His?</para>
                    <para>His words will work. His words will save. His words contain all hope, all
                        blessing and all joy that ever can be found upon this earth. His words are
                        born in God, and come to you with Heaven's love upon them. Those who hear
                        His words have heard the song of Heaven. For these are the words in which
                        all merge as one at last. And as this one will fade away, the Word of God
                        will come to take its place, for it will be remembered then and
                        loved.</para>
                    <para>This world has many seeming separate haunts where mercy has no meaning,
                        and attack appears as justified. Yet all are one; a place where death is
                        offered to God's Son and to his Father. You may think They have accepted.
                        But if you will look again upon the place where you beheld Their blood, you
                        will perceive a miracle instead. How foolish to believe that They could die!
                        How foolish to believe you can attack! How mad to think that you could be
                        condemned, and that the holy Son of God can die!</para>
                    <para>The stillness of your Self remains unmoved, untouched by thoughts like
                        these, and unaware of any condemnation which could need forgiveness. Dreams
                        of any kind are strange and alien to the truth. And what but truth could
                        have a Thought which builds a bridge to it that brings illusions to the
                        other side?</para>
                    <para>Today we practice letting freedom come to make its home with you. The
                        truth bestows these words upon your mind, that you may find the key to light
                        and let the darkness end:</para>
                    <blockquote>
                        <para>Only my condemnation injures                            me.</para>
                        <para>Only my own forgiveness sets me                                free.</para>
                    </blockquote>
                    <para>Do not forget today that there can be no form of suffering that fails to
                        hide an unforgiving thought. Nor can there be a form of pain forgiveness
                        cannot heal.</para>
                    <para>Accept the one illusion which proclaims there is no condemnation in God's
                        Son, and Heaven is remembered instantly; the world forgotten, all its weird
                        beliefs forgotten with it, as the face of Christ appears unveiled at last in
                        this one dream. This is the gift the Holy Spirit holds for you from God your
                        Father. Let today be celebrated both on earth and in your holy home as well.
                        Be kind to Both, as you forgive the trespasses you thought Them guilty of,
                        and see your innocence shining upon you from the face of Christ.</para>
                    <para>Now is there silence all around the world. Now is there stillness where
                        before there was a frantic rush of thoughts that made no sense. Now is there
                        tranquil light across the face of earth, made quiet in a dreamless sleep.
                        And now the Word of God alone remains upon it. Only that can be perceived an
                        instant longer. Then are symbols done, and everything you ever thought you
                        made completely vanished from the mind that God forever knows to be His only
                        Son.</para>
                    <para>There is no condemnation in him. He is perfect in his holiness. He needs
                        no thoughts of mercy. Who could give him gifts when everything is his? And
                        who could dream of offering forgiveness to the Son of Sinlessness Itself, so
                        like to Him Whose Son he is, that to behold the Son is to perceive no more,
                        and only know the Father? In this vision of the Son, so brief that not an
                        instant stands between this single sight and timelessness itself, you see
                        the vision of yourself, and then you disappear forever into God.</para>
                    <para>Today we come still nearer to the end of everything that yet would stand
                        between this vision and our sight. And we are glad that we have come this
                        far, and recognize that He Who brought us here will not forsake us now. For
                        He would give to us the gift that God has given us through Him today. Now is
                        the time for your deliverance. The time has come. The time has come
                        today.</para>

                    <para>Freedom must be impossible as long as you perceive a body as yourself. The
                        body is a limit. Who would seek for freedom in a body looks for it where it
                        can not be found. The mind can be made free when it no longer sees itself as
                        in a body, firmly tied to it and sheltered by its presence. If this were the
                        truth, the mind were vulnerable indeed!</para>
                    <para>The mind that serves the Holy Spirit is unlimited forever, in all ways,
                        beyond the laws of time and space, unbound by any preconceptions, and with
                        strength and power to do whatever it is asked. Attack thoughts cannot enter
                        such a mind, because it has been given to the Source of love, and fear can
                        never enter in a mind that has attached itself to love. It rests in God. And
                        who can be afraid who lives in Innocence, and only loves?</para>
                    <para>It is essential for your progress in this course that you accept today's
                        idea, and hold it very dear. Be not concerned that to the ego it is quite
                        insane. The ego holds the body dear because it dwells in it, and lives
                        united with the home that it has made. It is a part of the illusion that has
                        sheltered it from being found illusory itself.</para>
                    <para>Here does it hide, and here it can be seen as what it is. Declare your
                        innocence and you are free. The body disappears, because you have no need of
                        it except the need the Holy Spirit sees. For this, the body will appear as
                        useful form for what the mind must do. It thus becomes a vehicle which helps
                        forgiveness be extended to the all-inclusive goal that it must reach,
                        according to God's plan.</para>
                    <para>Cherish today's idea, and practice it today and every day. Make it a part
                        of every practice period you take. There is no thought that will not gain
                        thereby in power to help the world, and none which will not gain in added
                        gifts to you as well. We sound the call of freedom round the world with this
                        idea. And would you be exempt from the acceptance of the gifts you
                        give?</para>
                    <para>The Holy Spirit is the home of minds that seek for freedom. In Him they
                        have found what they have sought. The body's purpose now is unambiguous. And
                        it becomes perfect in the ability to serve an undivided goal. In
                        conflict-free and unequivocal response to mind with but the thought of
                        freedom as its goal, the body serves, and serves its purpose well. Without
                        the power to enslave, it is a worthy servant of the freedom which the mind
                        within the Holy Spirit seeks.</para>
                    <para>Be free today. And carry freedom as your gift to those who still believe
                        they are enslaved within a body. Be you free, so that the Holy Spirit can
                        make use of your escape from bondage, to set free the many who perceive
                        themselves as bound and helpless and afraid. Let love replace their fears
                        through you. Accept salvation now, and give your mind to Him Who calls to
                        you to make this gift to Him. For He would give you perfect freedom, perfect
                        joy, and hope that finds its full accomplishment in God.</para>
                    <para>You are God's Son. In immortality you live forever. Would you not return
                        your mind to this? Then practice well the thought the Holy Spirit gives you
                        for today. Your brothers stand released with you in it; the world is blessed
                        along with you, God's Son will weep no more, and Heaven offers thanks for
                        the increase of joy your practice brings even to it. And God Himself extends
                        His Love and happiness each time you say:</para>

                    <para>Seek you no further. You will not find peace except the peace of God.
                        Accept this fact, and save yourself the agony of yet more bitter
                        disappointments, bleak despair, and sense of icy hopelessness and doubt.
                        Seek you no further. There is nothing else for you to find except the peace
                        of God, unless you seek for misery and pain.</para>
                    <para>This is the final point to which each one must come at last, to lay aside
                        all hope of finding happiness where there is none; of being saved by what
                        can only hurt; of making peace of chaos, joy of pain, and Heaven out of
                        hell. Attempt no more to win through losing, nor to die to live. You cannot
                        but be asking for defeat.</para>
                    <para>Yet you can ask as easily for love, for happiness, and for eternal life in
                        peace that has no ending. Ask for this, and you can only win. To ask for
                        what you have already must succeed. To ask that what is false be true can
                        only fail. Forgive yourself for vain imaginings, and seek no longer what you
                        cannot find. For what could be more foolish than to seek and seek and seek
                        again for hell, when you have but to look with open eyes to find that Heaven
                        lies before you, through a door that opens easily to welcome you?</para>
                    <para>Come home. You have not found your happiness in foreign places and in
                        alien forms that have no meaning to you, though you sought to make them
                        meaningful. This world is not where you belong. You are a stranger here. But
                        it is given you to find the means whereby the world no longer seems to be a
                        prison house or jail for anyone.</para>
                    <para>Freedom is given you where you beheld but chains and iron doors. But you
                        must change your mind about the purpose of the world, if you would find
                        escape. You will be bound till all the world is seen by you as blessed, and
                        everyone made free of your mistakes and honored as he is. You made him not;
                        no more yourself. And as you free the one, the other is accepted as he
                        is.</para>
                    <para>What does forgiveness do? In truth it has no function, and does nothing.
                        For it is unknown in Heaven. It is only hell where it is needed, and where
                        it must serve a mighty function. Is not the escape of God's beloved Son from
                        evil dreams that he imagines, yet believes are true, a worthy purpose? Who
                        could hope for more, while there appears to be a choice to make between
                        success and failure; love and fear?</para>
                    <para>There is no peace except the peace of God, because He has one Son who
                        cannot make a world in opposition to God's Will and to his own, which is the
                        same as His. What could he hope to find in such a world? It cannot have
                        reality, because it never was created. Is it here that he would seek for
                        peace? Or must he see that, as he looks on it, the world can but deceive?
                        Yet can he learn to look on it another way, and find the peace of
                        God.</para>
                    <para>Peace is the bridge that everyone will cross, to leave this world behind.
                        But peace begins within the world perceived as different, and leading from
                        this fresh perception to the gate of Heaven and the way beyond. Peace is the
                        answer to conflicting goals, to senseless journeys, frantic, vain pursuits,
                        and meaningless endeavors. Now the way is easy, sloping gently toward the
                        bridge where freedom lies within the peace of God.</para>
                    <para>Let us not lose our way again today. We go to Heaven, and the path is
                        straight. Only if we attempt to wander can there be delay, and needless
                        wasted time on thorny byways. God alone is sure, and He will guide our
                        footsteps. He will not desert His Son in need, nor let him stray forever
                        from his home. The Father calls; the Son will hear. And that is all there is
                        to what appears to be a world apart from God, where bodies have
                        reality.</para>
                    <para>Now is there silence. Seek no further. You have come to where the road is
                        carpeted with leaves of false desires, fallen from the trees of hopelessness
                        you sought before. Now are they underfoot. And you look up and on toward
                        Heaven, with the body's eyes but serving for an instant longer now. Peace is
                        already recognized at last, and you can feel its soft embrace surround your

                    <para>Today we seek no idols. Peace can not be found in them. The peace of God
                        is ours, and only this will we accept and want. Peace be to us today. For we
                        have found a simple, happy way to leave the world of ambiguity, and to
                        replace our shifting goals and solitary dreams with single purpose and
                        companionship. For peace is union, if it be of God. We seek no further. We
                        are close to home, and draw still nearer every time we say:</para>

                    <title>Review VI Introduction (Lessons 181 - 200)</title>
                    <para>For this review we take but one idea each day, and practice it as often as
                        is possible. Besides the time you give morning and evening, which should not
                        be less than fifteen minutes, and the hourly remembrances you make
                        throughout the day, use the idea as often as you can between them. Each of
                        these ideas alone would be sufficient for salvation, if it were learned
                        truly. Each would be enough to give release to you and to the world from
                        every form of bondage, and invite the memory of God to come again.</para>
                    <para>With this in mind we start our practicing, in which we carefully review
                        the thoughts the Holy Spirit has bestowed on us in our last twenty lessons.
                        Each contains the whole curriculum if understood, practiced, accepted, and
                        applied to all the seeming happenings throughout the day. One is enough. But
                        from that one, there must be no exceptions made. And so we need to use them
                        all and let them blend as one, as each contributes to the whole we
                        learn.</para>
                    <para>These practice sessions, like our last review, are centered round a
                        central theme with which we start and end each lesson. It is this:<blockquote>
                            <para>I am not a body. I am                                free.</para>
                            <para>For I am still as God created                                    me.</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>The day begins and ends with this. And we repeat it every time the hour
                        strikes, or we remember, in between, we have a function that transcends the
                        world we see. Beyond this, and a repetition of the special thought we
                        practice for the day, no form of exercise is urged, except a deep
                        relinquishment of everything that clutters up the mind, and makes it deaf to
                        reason, sanity and simple truth.</para>
                    <para>We will attempt to get beyond all words and special forms of practicing
                        for this review. For we attempt, this time, to reach a quickened pace along
                        a shorter path to the serenity and peace of God. We merely close our eyes,
                        and then forget all that we thought we knew and understood. For thus is
                        freedom given us from all we did not know and failed to understand.</para>
                    <para>There is but one exception to this lack of structuring. Permit no idle
                        thought to To Him I offer this review for you. I place you in His charge,
                        and let Him teach you what to do and say and think, each time you turn to
                        Him. He will not fail to be available to you, each time you call to Him to
                        help you. Let us offer Him the whole review we now begin, and let us also
                        not forget to Whom it has been given, as we practice day by day, advancing
                        toward the goal He set for us; allowing Him to teach us how to go, and
                        trusting Him completely for the way each practice period can best become a
                        loving gift of freedom to the world.go unchallenged. If you notice one, deny
                        its hold and hasten to assure your mind that this is not what it would have.
                        Then gently let the thought which you denied be given up, in sure and quick
                        exchange for the idea we practice for the day.</para>
                    <para>When you are tempted, hasten to proclaim your freedom from temptation, as
                        you say:<blockquote>
                            <para>This thought I do not want. I choose                                    instead ______</para>
                        </blockquote></para>
                    <para>And then repeat the idea for the day, and let it take the place of what
                        you thought. Beyond such special applications of each day's idea, we will
                        add but a few formal expressions or specific thoughts to aid in practicing.
                        Instead, we give these times of quiet to the Teacher Who instructs in quiet,
                        speaks of peace, and gives our thoughts whatever meaning they may
                        have.</para>

            <title>Workbook Part II. Introduction</title>
            <para> Words will mean little now. We use them but as guides on which we do not now
                depend. For now we seek direct experience of truth alone. The lessons that remain
                are merely introductions to the times in which we leave the world of pain, and go to
                enter peace. Now we begin to reach the goal this course has set, and find the end
                toward which our practicing was always geared. </para>
            <para>Now we attempt to let the exercise be merely a beginning. For we wait in quiet
                expectation for our God and Father. He has promised He will take the final step
                Himself. And we are sure His promises are kept. We have come far along the road, and
                now we wait for Him. We will continue spending time with Him each morning and at
                night, as long as makes us happy. We will not consider time a matter of duration
                now. We use as much as we will need for the result that we desire. Nor will we
                forget our hourly remembrance in between, calling to God when we have need of Him as
                we are tempted to forget our goal.</para>
            <para>We will continue with a central thought for all the days to come, and we will use
                that thought to introduce our times of rest, and calm our minds at need. Yet we will
                not content ourselves with simple practicing in the remaining holy instants which
                conclude the year that we have given God. We say some simple words of welcome, and
                expect our Father to reveal Himself, as He has promised. We have called on Him, and
                He has promised that His Son will not remain unanswered when he calls His
                Name.</para>
            <para>Now do we come to Him with but His Word upon our minds and hearts, and wait for
                Him to take the step to us that He has told us, through His Voice, He would not fail
                to take when we invited Him. He has not left His Son in all his madness, nor
                betrayed his trust in Him. Has not His faithfulness earned Him the invitation that
                He seeks to make us happy? We will offer it, and it will be accepted. So our times
                with Him will now be spent. We say the words of invitation that His Voice suggests,
                and then we wait for Him to come to us.</para>
            <para>Now is the time of prophecy fulfilled. Now are all ancient promises upheld and
                fully kept. No step remains for time to separate from its accomplishment. For now we
                cannot fail. Sit silently and wait upon your Father. He has willed to come to you
                when you have recognized it is your will He do so. And you could have never come
                this far unless you saw, however dimly, that it is your will.</para>
            <para>I am so close to you we cannot fail. Father, we give these holy times to You, in
                gratitude to Him Who taught us how to leave the world of sorrow in exchange for its
                replacement, given us by You. We look not backward now. We look ahead, and fix our
                eyes upon the journey's end. Accept these little gifts of thanks from us, as through
                Christ's vision we behold a world beyond the one we made, and take that world to be
                the full replacement of our own.</para>
            <para>And now we wait in silence, unafraid and certain of Your coming. We have sought to
                find our way by following the Guide You sent to us. We did not know the way, but You
                did not forget us. And we know that You will not forget us now. We ask but that Your
                ancient promises be kept which are Your Will to keep. We will with You in asking
                this. The Father and the Son, Whose holy Will created all that is, can fail in
                nothing. In this certainty, we undertake these last few steps to You, and rest in
                confidence upon Your Love, which will not fail the Son who calls to You.</para>
            <para>And so we start upon the final part of this one holy year, which we have spent
                together in the search for truth and God, Who is its one Creator. We have found the
                way He chose for us, and made the choice to follow it as He would have us go. His
                Hand has held us up. His Thoughts have lit the darkness of our minds. His Love has
                called to us unceasingly since time began.</para>
            <para>We had a wish that God would fail to have the Son whom He created for Himself. We
                wanted God to change Himself, and be what we would make of Him. And we believed that
                our insane desires were the truth. Now we are glad that this is all undone, and we
                no longer think illusions true. The memory of God is shimmering across the wide
                horizons of our minds. A moment more, and it will rise again. A moment more, and we
                who are God's Sons are safely home, where He would have us be.</para>
            <para>Now is the need for practice almost done. For in this final section, we will come
                to understand that we need only call to God, and all temptations disappear. Instead
                of words, we need but feel His Love. Instead of prayers, we need but call His Name.
                Instead of judging, we need but be still and let all things be healed. We will
                accept the way God's plan will end, as we received the way it started. Now it is
                complete. This year has brought us to eternity.</para>
            <para>One further use for words we still retain. From time to time, instructions on a
                theme of special relevance will intersperse our daily lessons and the periods of
                wordless, deep experience which should come afterwards. These special thoughts
                should be reviewed each day, each one of them to be continued till the next is given
                you. They should be slowly read and thought about a little while, preceding one of
                the holy and blessed instants in the day. We give the first of these instructions
                now.</para>

                    <para> Forgiveness recognizes what you thought your brother did to you has not
                        occurred. It does not pardon sins and make them real. It sees there was no
                        sin. And in that view are all your sins forgiven. What is sin, except a
                        false idea about God's Son? Forgiveness merely sees its falsity, and
                        therefore lets it go. What then is free to take its place is now the Will of
                        God.</para>
                    <para>An unforgiving thought is one which makes a judgment that it will not
                        raise to doubt, although it is not true. The mind is closed, and will not be
                        released. The thought protects projection, tightening its chains, so that
                        distortions are more veiled and more obscure; less easily accessible to
                        doubt, and further kept from reason. What can come between a fixed
                        projection and the aim that it has chosen as its wanted goal?</para>
                    <para>An unforgiving thought does many things. In frantic action it pursues its
                        goal, twisting and overturning what it sees as interfering with its chosen
                        path. Distortion is its purpose, and the means by which it would accomplish
                        it as well. It sets about its furious attempts to smash reality, without
                        concern for anything that would appear to pose a contradiction to its point
                        of view.</para>
                    <para>Forgiveness, on the other hand, is still, and quietly does nothing. It
                        offends no aspect of reality, nor seeks to twist it to appearances it likes.
                        It merely looks, and waits, and judges not. He who would not forgive must
                        judge, for he must justify his failure to forgive. But he who would forgive
                        himself must learn to welcome truth exactly as it is.</para>
                    <para>Do nothing, then, and let forgiveness show you what to do, through Him Who
                        is your Guide, your Savior and Protector, strong in hope, and certain of
                        your ultimate success. He has forgiven you already, for such is His
                        function, given Him by God. Now must you share His function, and forgive
                        whom He has saved, whose sinlessness He sees, and whom He honors as the Son
                        of God.</para>

                        at last. It cannot but be kept. It guarantees that time will have an end,
                        and all the thoughts that have been born in time will end as well. God's
                        Word is given every mind which thinks that it has separate thoughts, and
                        will replace these thoughts of conflict with the Thought of peace.</para>
                    <para>The Thought of peace was given to God's Son the instant that his mind had
                        thought of war. There was no need for such a Thought before, for peace was
                        given without opposite, and merely was. But when the mind is split there is
                        a need of healing. So the Thought that has the power to heal the split
                        became a part of every fragment of the mind that still was one, but failed
                        to recognize its oneness. Now it did not know itself, and thought its own
                        Identity was lost.</para>
                    <para>Salvation is undoing in the sense that it does nothing, failing to support
                        the world of dreams and malice. Thus it lets illusions go. By not supporting
                        them, it merely lets them quietly go down to dust. And what they hid is now
                        revealed; an altar to the holy Name of God whereon His Word is written, with
                        the gifts of your forgiveness laid before it, and the memory of God not far
                        behind.</para>
                    <para>Let us come daily to this holy place, and spend a while together. Here we
                        share our final dream. It is a dream in which there is no sorrow, for it
                        holds a hint of all the glory given us by God. The grass is pushing through
                        the soil, the trees are budding now, and birds have come to live within
                        their branches. Earth is being born again in new perspective. Night has
                        gone, and we have come together in the light.</para>
                    <para>From here we give salvation to the world, for it is here salvation was
                        received. The song of our rejoicing is the call to all the world that
                        freedom is returned, that time is almost over, and God's Son has but an
                        instant more to wait until his Father is remembered, dreams are done,
                        eternity has shined away the world, and only Heaven now exists at
                        all.</para>

                        cherished. When the thought of separation has been changed to one of true
                        forgiveness, will the world be seen in quite another light; and one which
                        leads to truth, where all the world must disappear and all its errors
                        vanish. Now its source has gone, and its effects are gone as well.</para>
                    <para>The world was made as an attack on God. It symbolizes fear. And what is
                        fear except love's absence? Thus the world was meant to be a place where God
                        could enter not, and where His Son could be apart from Him. Here was
                        perception born, for knowledge could not cause such insane thoughts. But
                        eyes deceive, and ears hear falsely. Now mistakes become quite possible, for
                        certainty has gone.</para>
                    <para>The mechanisms of illusion have been born instead. And now they go to find
                        what has been given them to seek. Their aim is to fulfill the purpose which
                        the world was made to witness and make real. They see in its illusions but a
                        solid base where truth exists, upheld apart from lies. Yet everything that
                        they report is but illusion which is kept apart from truth.</para>
                    <para>As sight was made to lead away from truth, it can be redirected. Sounds
                        become the call for God, and all perception can be given a new purpose by
                        the One Whom God appointed Savior to the world. Follow His light, and see
                        the world as He beholds it. Hear His Voice alone in all that speaks to you.

                    <para>Sin is insanity. It is the means by which the mind is driven mad, and
                        seeks to let illusions take the place of truth. And being mad, it sees
                        illusions where the truth should be, and where it really is. Sin gave the
                        body eyes, for what is there the sinless would behold? What need have they
                        of sights or sounds or touch? What would they hear or reach to grasp? What
                        would they sense at all? To sense is not to know. And truth can be but
                        filled with knowledge, and with nothing else.</para>
                    <para>The body is the instrument the mind made in its efforts to deceive itself.
                        Its purpose is to strive. Yet can the goal of striving change. And now the
                        body serves a different aim for striving. What it seeks for now is chosen by
                        the aim the mind has taken as replacement for the goal of self-deception.
                        Truth can be its aim as well as lies. The senses then will seek instead for
                        witnesses to what is true.</para>
                    <para>Sin is the home of all illusions, which but stand for things imagined,
                        issuing from thoughts that are untrue. They are the "proof" that what has no
                        reality is real. Sin "proves" God's Son is evil; timelessness must have an
                        end; eternal life must die. And God Himself has lost the Son He loves, with
                        but corruption to complete Himself, His Will forever overcome by death, love
                        slain by hate, and peace to be no more.</para>
                    <para>A madman's dreams are frightening, and sin appears indeed to terrify. And
                        yet what sin perceives is but a childish game. The Son of God may play he
                        has become a body, prey to evil and to guilt, with but a little life that
                        ends in death. But all the while his Father shines on him, and loves him
                        with an everlasting Love which his pretenses cannot change at all.</para>

                        put away these sharp-edged children's toys? How soon will you be ready to
                        come home? Perhaps today? There is no sin. Creation is unchanged. Would you

                    <para>The body is a fence the Son of God imagines he has built, to separate
                        parts of his Self from other parts. It is within this fence he thinks he
                        lives, to die as it decays and crumbles. For within this fence he thinks
                        that he is safe from love. Identifying with his safety, he regards himself
                        as what his safety is. How else could he be certain he remains within the
                        body, keeping love outside?</para>
                    <para>The body will not stay. Yet this he sees as double safety. For the Son of
                        God's impermanence is "proof" his fences work, and do the task his mind
                        assigns to them. For if his oneness still remained untouched, who could
                        attack and who could be attacked? Who could be victor? Who could be his
                        prey? Who could be victim? Who the murderer? And if he did not die, what
                        "proof" is there that God's eternal Son can be destroyed?</para>
                    <para>The body is a dream. Like other dreams it sometimes seems to picture
                        happiness, but can quite suddenly revert to fear, where every dream is born.
                        For only love creates in truth, and truth can never fear. Made to be
                        fearful, must the body serve the purpose given it. But we can change the
                        purpose that the body will obey by changing what we think that it is
                        for.</para>
                    <para>The body is the means by which God's Son returns to sanity. Though it was
                        made to fence him into hell without escape, yet has the goal of Heaven been
                        exchanged for the pursuit of hell. The Son of God extends his hand to reach
                        his brother, and to help him walk along the road with him. Now is the body
                        holy. Now it serves to heal the mind that it was made to kill.</para>
                    <para>You will identify with what you think will make you safe. Whatever it may

                        not in lies. Love is your safety. Fear does not exist. Identify with love,
                        and you are safe. Identify with love, and you are home. Identify with love,

                        bids them come to Him, to be translated into truth. He will exchange them
                        for the final dream which God appointed as the end of dreams. For when
                        forgiveness rests upon the world and peace has come to every Son of God,
                        what could there be to keep things separate, for what remains to see except
                        Christ's face?</para>
                    <para>And how long will this holy face be seen, when it is but the symbol that
                        the time for learning now is over, and the goal of the Atonement has been
                        reached at last? So therefore let us seek to find Christ's face and look on
                        nothing else. As we behold His glory, will we know we have no need of
                        learning or perception or of time, or anything except the holy Self, the
                        Christ Whom God created as His Son.</para>

                    <para>The Holy Spirit mediates between illusions and the truth. Since He must
                        bridge the gap between reality and dreams, perception leads to knowledge
                        through the grace that God has given Him, to be His gift to everyone who
                        turns to Him for truth. Across the bridge that He provides are dreams all
                        carried to the truth, to be dispelled before the light of knowledge. There
                        are sights and sounds forever laid aside. And where they were perceived
                        before, forgiveness has made possible perception's tranquil end.</para>
                    <para>The goal the Holy Spirit's teaching sets is just this end of dreams. For
                        sights and sounds must be translated from the witnesses of fear to those of
                        love. And when this is entirely accomplished, learning has achieved the only
                        goal it has in truth. For learning, as the Holy Spirit guides it to the
                        outcome He perceives for it, becomes the means to go beyond itself, to be
                        replaced by the eternal truth.</para>

                        His replacement for the fearful images and dreams you made. The Holy Spirit
                        understands the means you made, by which you would attain what is forever
                        unattainable. And if you offer them to Him, He will employ the means you
                        made for exile to restore your mind to where it truly is at home.</para>
                    <para>From knowledge, where He has been placed by God, the Holy Spirit calls to
                        you, to let forgiveness rest upon your dreams, and be restored to sanity and
                        peace of mind. Without forgiveness will your dreams remain to terrify you.
                        And the memory of all your Father's Love will not return to signify the end

                                    that I am hurt in any way, it is because I have forgotten who I
                                    am, and that I am as You created me. Your Thoughts can only
                                    bring me happiness. If ever I am sad or hurt or ill, I have
                                    forgotten what You think, and put my little meaningless ideas in
                                    place of where Your Thoughts belong, and where they are. I can
                                    be hurt by nothing but my thoughts. The Thoughts I think with
                                    You can only bless. The Thoughts I think with You alone are
                                    true.</para>

                        eyes of fear, and brings the witnesses of terror to your mind. The real
                        world cannot be perceived except through eyes forgiveness blesses, so they
                        see a world where terror is impossible, and witnesses to fear can not be
                        found.</para>
                    <para>The real world holds a counterpart for each unhappy thought reflected in
                        your world; a sure correction for the sights of fear and sounds of battle
                        which your world contains. The real world shows a world seen differently,
                        through quiet eyes and with a mind at peace. Nothing but rest is there.
                        There are no cries of pain and sorrow heard, for nothing there remains
                        outside forgiveness. And the sights are gentle. Only happy sights and sounds
                        can reach the mind that has forgiven itself.</para>
                    <para>What need has such a mind for thoughts of death, attack and murder? What
                        can it perceive surrounding it but safety, love and joy? What is there it
                        would choose to be condemned, and what is there that it would judge against?
                        The world it sees arises from a mind at peace within itself. No danger lurks
                        in anything it sees, for it is kind, and only kindness does it look
                        upon.</para>
                    <para>The real world is the symbol that the dream of sin and guilt is over, and
                        God's Son no longer sleeps. His waking eyes perceive the sure reflection of
                        his Father's Love; the certain promise that he is redeemed. The real world
                        signifies the end of time, for its perception makes time purposeless.</para>
                    <para>The Holy Spirit has no need of time when it has served His purpose. Now He
                        waits but that one instant more for God to take His final step, and time has
                        disappeared, taking perception with it as it goes, and leaving but the truth
                        to be itself. That instant is our goal, for it contains the memory of God.
                        And as we look upon a world forgiven, it is He Who calls to us and comes to
                        take us home, reminding us of our Identity which our forgiveness has
                        restored to us.</para>

                    <para> This is a thought which can be used to say that death and sorrow are the
                        certain lot of all who come here, for their joys are gone before they are
                        possessed, or even grasped. Yet this is also the idea that lets no false
                        perception keep us in its hold, nor represent more than a passing cloud upon
                        a sky eternally serene. And it is this serenity we seek, unclouded, obvious
                        and sure, today. </para>

                    <para>Christ's Second Coming, which is sure as God, is merely the correction of
                        mistakes, and the return of sanity. It is a part of the condition that
                        restores the never lost, and re-establishes what is forever and forever
                        true. It is the invitation to God's Word to take illusion's place; the
                        willingness to let forgiveness rest upon all things without exception and
                        without reserve.</para>
                    <para>It is the all-inclusive nature of Christ's Second Coming that permits it
                        to embrace the world and hold you safe within its gentle advent, which
                        encompasses all living things with you. There is no end to the release the
                        Second Coming brings, as God's creation must be limitless. Forgiveness
                        lights the Second Coming's way, because it shines on everything as one. And
                        thus is oneness recognized at last.</para>
                    <para>The Second Coming ends the lessons that the Holy Spirit teaches, making
                        way for the Last Judgment, in which learning ends in one last summary that
                        will extend beyond itself, and reaches up to God. The Second Coming is the
                        time in which all minds are given to the hands of Christ, to be returned to
                        spirit in the name of true creation and the Will of God.</para>
                    <para>The Second Coming is the one event in time which time itself can not
                        affect. For every one who ever came to die, or yet will come or who is
                        present now, is equally released from what he made. In this equality is
                        Christ restored as one Identity, in which the Sons of God acknowledge that
                        they all are one. And God the Father smiles upon His Son, His one creation
                        and His only joy.</para>
                    <para>Pray that the Second Coming will be soon, but do not rest with that. It
                        needs your eyes and ears and hands and feet. It needs your voice. And most
                        of all it needs your willingness. Let us rejoice that we can do God's Will,
                        and join together in its holy light. Behold, the Son of God is one in us,
                        and we can reach our Father's Love through Him.</para>

                        understand. But we have learned the world we saw was false, and we will look
                        upon God's world today.</para>

                    <para>Christ's Second Coming gives the Son of God this gift: to hear the Voice
                        for God proclaim that what is false is false, and what is true has never
                        changed. And this the judgment is in which perception ends. At first you see
                        a world that has accepted this as true, projected from a now corrected mind.
                        And with this holy sight, perception gives a silent blessing and then
                        disappears, its goal accomplished and its mission done.</para>
                    <para>The final judgment on the world contains no condemnation. For it sees the
                        world as totally forgiven, without sin and wholly purposeless. Without a
                        cause, and now without a function in Christ's sight, it merely slips away to
                        nothingness. There it was born, and there it ends as well. And all the
                        figures in the dream in which the world began go with it. Bodies now are
                        useless, and will therefore fade away, because the Son of God is
                        limitless.</para>
                    <para>You who believed that God's Last Judgment would condemn the world to hell
                        along with you, accept this holy truth: God's Judgment is the gift of the
                        Correction He bestowed on all your errors, freeing you from them, and all
                        effects they ever seemed to have. To fear God's saving grace is but to fear
                        complete release from suffering, return to peace, security and happiness,
                        and union with your own Identity.</para>
                    <para>God's Final Judgment is as merciful as every step in His appointed plan to
                        bless His Son, and call him to return to the eternal peace He shares with
                        him. Be not afraid of love. For it alone can heal all sorrow, wipe away all
                        tears, and gently waken from his dream of pain the Son whom God acknowledges
                        as His. Be not afraid of this. Salvation asks you give it welcome. And the
                        world awaits your glad acceptance, which will set it free.</para>
                    <para>This is God's Final Judgment: "You are still My holy Son, forever
                        innocent, forever loving and forever loved, as limitless as your Creator,
                        and completely changeless and forever pure. Therefore awaken and return to
                        Me. I am your Father and you are My Son."</para>

                    <para>Judgment was made to be a weapon used against the truth. It separates what

                        for it. He will relieve us of the agony of all the judgments we have made

                                    This vision is Your gift. The eyes of Christ look on a world

                    <para> I have a special place to fill; a role for me alone. Salvation waits
                        until I take this part as what I choose to do. Until I make this choice, I
                        am the slave of time and human destiny. But when I willingly and gladly go
                        the way my Father's plan appointed me to go, then will I recognize salvation
                        is already here, already given all my brothers and already mine as well. </para>

                                    do I choose to do. Your way is certain, and the end secure. The
                                    memory of You awaits me there. And all my sorrows end in Your
                                    embrace, which You have promised to Your Son, who thought

                        saved, because salvation's purpose is to find the sinlessness that God has
                        placed in me. I was created as the thing I seek. I am the goal the world is
                        searching for. I am God's Son, His one eternal Love. I am salvation's means

                        the truth will come immediately, and fill up the space the ego left
                        unoccupied by lies. Only the ego can be limited, and therefore it must seek
                        for aims which are curtailed and limiting. The ego thinks that what one
                        gains, totality must lose. And yet it is the Will of God I learn that what
                        one gains is given unto all. </para>

                    <para>Creation is the sum of all God's Thoughts, in number infinite, and
                        everywhere without all limit. Only love creates, and only like itself. There
                        was no time when all that it created was not there. Nor will there be a time
                        when anything that it created suffers any loss. Forever and forever are
                        God's Thoughts exactly as they were and as they are, unchanged through time
                        and after time is done.</para>
                    <para>God's Thoughts are given all the power that their own Creator has. For He
                        would add to love by its extension. Thus His Son shares in creation, and
                        must therefore share in power to create. What God has willed to be forever
                        One will still be One when time is over; and will not be changed throughout
                        the course of time, remaining as it was before the thought of time
                        began.</para>
                    <para>Creation is the opposite of all illusions, for creation is the truth.
                        Creation is the holy Son of God, for in creation is His Will complete in
                        every aspect, making every part container of the whole. Its oneness is
                        forever guaranteed inviolate; forever held within His holy Will, beyond all
                        possibility of harm, of separation, imperfection and of any spot upon its
                        sinlessness.</para>
                    <para>We are creation; we the Sons of God. We seem to be discrete, and unaware
                        of our eternal unity with Him. Yet back of all our doubts, past all our
                        fears, there still is certainty. For love remains with all its Thoughts, its
                        sureness being theirs. God's memory is in our holy minds, which know their
                        oneness and their unity with their Creator. Let our function be only to let
                        this memory return, only to let God's Will be done on earth, only to be
                        restored to sanity, and to be but as God created us.</para>
                    <para>Our Father calls to us. We hear His Voice, and we forgive creation in the
                        Name of its Creator, Holiness Itself, Whose Holiness His Own creation
                        shares; Whose Holiness is still a part of us.</para>

                    <para>The ego is idolatry; the sign of limited and separated self, born in a
                        body, doomed to suffer and to end its life in death. It is the "will" that
                        sees the Will of God as enemy, and takes a form in which it is denied. The
                        ego is the "proof" that strength is weak and love is fearful, life is really
                        death, and what opposes God alone is true.</para>
                    <para>The ego is insane. In fear it stands beyond the Everywhere, apart from
                        All, in separation from the Infinite. In its insanity it thinks it has
                        become a victor over God Himself. And in its terrible autonomy it "sees" the
                        Will of God has been destroyed. It dreams of punishment, and trembles at the
                        figures in its dreams; its enemies, who seek to murder it before it can
                        ensure its safety by attacking them.</para>
                    <para>The Son of God is egoless. What can he know of madness and the death of
                        God, when he abides in Him? What can he know of sorrow and of suffering,
                        when he lives in eternal joy? What can he know of fear and punishment, of
                        sin and guilt, of hatred and attack, when all there is surrounding him is
                        everlasting peace, forever conflict-free and undisturbed, in deepest silence
                        and tranquility?</para>

                        salvation, and the cost belief in it entails. In suffering, the price for
                        faith in it is so immense that crucifixion of the Son of God is offered
                        daily at its darkened shrine, and blood must flow before the altar where its
                        sickly followers prepare to die.</para>

                        forever to the holy minds which God created as His Son, His dwelling place,
                        His joy, His love, completely His, completely one with Him.</para>

                                How could I think that Love has left Itself? There is no will except

                                with Yours. Conflict is sleep, and peace awakening. Death is
                                illusion; life, eternal truth. There is no opposition to Your Will.

                    <para> I will not wait another day to find the treasures that my Father offers
                        me. Illusions are all vain, and dreams are gone even while they are woven
                        out of thoughts that rest on false perceptions. Let me not accept such
                        meager gifts again today. God's Voice is offering the peace of God to all
                        who hear and choose to follow Him. This is my choice today. And so I go to

                    <para> Forgiveness is a choice. I never see my brother as he is, for that is far
                        beyond perception. What I see in him is merely what I wish to see, because
                        it stands for what I want to be the truth. It is to this alone that I
                        respond, however much I seem to be impelled by outside happenings. I choose
                        to see what I would look upon, and this I see, and only this. My brother's
                        sinlessness shows me that I would look upon my own. And I will see it,
                        having chosen to behold my brother in its holy light. </para>

                                    that he was created one with me, and like myself. In him I find

                    <para> Forgiveness is the means appointed for perception's ending. Knowledge is
                        restored after perception first is changed, and then gives way entirely to
                        what remains forever past its highest reach. For sights and sounds, at best,
                        can serve but to recall the memory that lies beyond them all. Forgiveness
                        sweeps away distortions, and opens the hidden altar to the truth. Its lilies
                        shine into the mind, and call it to return and look within, to find what it
                        has vainly sought without. For here, and only here, is peace of mind
                        restored, for this the dwelling place of God Himself. </para>

                    <para> No one desires pain. But he can think that pain is pleasure. No one would

                        indeed about the things he wants; the state he would attain. What can he
                        then request that he would want when he receives it? He has asked for what

                    <para>A miracle is a correction. It does not create, nor really change at all.
                        It merely looks on devastation, and reminds the mind that what it sees is
                        false. It undoes error, but does not attempt to go beyond perception, nor
                        exceed the function of forgiveness. Thus it stays within time's limits. Yet
                        it paves the way for the return of timelessness and love's awakening, for
                        fear must slip away under the gentle remedy it brings.</para>
                    <para>A miracle contains the gift of grace, for it is given and received as one.
                        And thus it illustrates the law of truth the world does not obey, because it
                        fails entirely to understand its ways. A miracle inverts perception which
                        was upside down before, and thus it ends the strange distortions that were
                        manifest. Now is perception open to the truth. Now is forgiveness seen as
                        justified.</para>
                    <para>Forgiveness is the home of miracles. The eyes of Christ deliver them to
                        all they look upon in mercy and in love. Perception stands corrected in His
                        sight, and what was meant to curse has come to bless. Each lily of
                        forgiveness offers all the world the silent miracle of love. And each is
                        laid before the Word of God, upon the universal altar to Creator and
                        creation in the light of perfect purity and endless joy.</para>
                    <para>The miracle is taken first on faith, because to ask for it implies the
                        mind has been made ready to conceive of what it cannot see and does not
                        understand. Yet faith will bring its witnesses to show that what it rested
                        on is really there. And thus the miracle will justify your faith in it, and
                        show it rested on a world more real than what you saw before; a world
                        redeemed from what you thought was there.</para>
                    <para>Miracles fall like drops of healing rain from Heaven on a dry and dusty
                        world, where starved and thirsty creatures come to die. Now they have water.
                        Now the world is green. And everywhere the signs of life spring up, to show
                        that what is born can never die, for what has life has immortality.</para>

                                    and clear. Choose, then, for me, my Father, through Your Voice.

                    <para>Our final lessons will be left as free of words as possible. We use them
                        but at the beginning of our practicing, and only to remind us that we seek
                        to go beyond them. Let us turn to Him Who leads the way and makes our
                        footsteps sure. To Him we leave these lessons, as to Him we give our lives
                        henceforth. For we would not return again to the belief in sin that made the
                        world seem ugly and unsafe, attacking and destroying, dangerous in all its
                        ways, and treacherous beyond the hope of trust and the escape from
                        pain.</para>
                    <para>His is the only way to find the peace that God has given us. It is His way
                        that everyone must travel in the end, because it is this ending God Himself
                        appointed. In the dream of time it seems to be far off. And yet, in truth,
                        it is already here; already serving us as gracious guidance in the way to
                        go. Let us together follow in the way that truth points out to us. And let
                        us be the leaders of our many brothers who are seeking for the way, but find
                        it not.</para>
                    <para>And to this purpose let us dedicate our minds, directing all our thoughts
                        to serve the function of salvation. Unto us the aim is given to forgive the
                        world. It is the goal that God has given us. It is His ending to the dream
                        we seek, and not our own. For all that we forgive we will not fail to
                        recognize as part of God Himself. And thus His memory is given back,
                        completely and complete.</para>
                    <para>It is our function to remember Him on earth, as it is given us to be His
                        Own completion in reality. So let us not forget our goal is shared, for it
                        is that remembrance which contains the memory of God, and points the way to
                        Him and to the Heaven of His peace. And shall we not forgive our brother,
                        who can offer this to us? He is the way, the truth and life that shows the
                        way to us. In him resides salvation, offered us through our forgiveness,
                        given unto him.</para>

                        belonged to God, and found it was a dream. We are restored to sanity, in
                        which we understand that anger is insane, attack is mad, and vengeance
                        merely foolish fantasy. We have been saved from wrath because we learned we
                        were mistaken. Nothing more than that. And is a father angry at his son
                        because he failed to understand the truth?</para>
                    <para>We come in honesty to God and say we did not understand, and ask Him to
                        help us to learn His lessons, through the Voice of His Own Teacher. Would He
                        hurt His Son? Or would He rush to answer him, and say, "This is My Son, and
                        all I have is his"? Be certain He will answer thus, for these are His Own
                        words to you. And more than that can no one ever have, for in these words is
                        all there is, and all that there will be throughout all time and in
                        eternity.</para>

        <title>Epilogue</title>
        <para>This course is a beginning, not an end. Your Friend goes with you. You are not alone.
            No one who calls on Him can call in vain. Whatever troubles you, be certain that He has
            the answer, and will gladly give it to you, if you simply turn to Him and ask it of Him.
            He will not withhold all answers that you need for anything that seems to trouble you.
            He knows the way to solve all problems, and resolve all doubts. His certainty is yours.
            You need but ask it of Him, and it will be given you.</para>
        <para>You are as certain of arriving home as is the pathway of the sun laid down before it
            rises, after it has set, and in the half-lit hours in between. Indeed, your pathway is
            more certain still. For it can not be possible to change the course of those whom God
            has called to Him. Therefore obey your will, and follow Him Whom you accepted as your
            voice, to speak of what you really want and really need. His is the Voice for God and
            also yours. And thus He speaks of freedom and of truth.</para>
        <para>No more specific lessons are assigned, for there is no more need of them. Henceforth,
            hear but the Voice for God and for your Self when you retire from the world, to seek
            reality instead. He will direct your efforts, telling you exactly what to do, how to
            direct your mind, and when to come to Him in silence, asking for His sure direction and
            His certain Word. His is the Word that God has given you. His is the Word you chose to
            be your own.</para>
        <para>And now I place you in His hands, to be His faithful follower, with Him as Guide
            through every difficulty and all pain that you may think is real. Nor will He give you
            pleasures that will pass away, for He gives only the eternal and the good. Let Him
            prepare you further. He has earned your trust by speaking daily to you of your Father
            and your brother and your Self. He will continue. Now you walk with Him, as certain as
            is He of where you go; as sure as He of how you should proceed; as confident as He is of
            the goal, and of your safe arrival in the end.</para>
        <para>The end is certain, and the means as well. To this we say "Amen." You will be told
            exactly what God wills for you each time there is a choice to make. And He will speak
            for God and for your Self, thus making sure that hell will claim you not, and that each
            choice you make brings Heaven nearer to your reach. And so we walk with Him from this
            time on, and turn to Him for guidance and for peace and sure direction. Joy attends our
            way. For we go homeward to an open door which God has held unclosed to welcome
            us.</para>
        <para>We trust our ways to Him and say "Amen." In peace we will continue in His way, and
            trust all things to Him. In confidence we wait His answers, as we ask His Will in
            everything we do. He loves God's Son as we would love him. And He teaches us how to
            behold him through His eyes, and love him as He does. You do not walk alone. God's
            angels hover near and all about. His Love surrounds you, and of this be sure; that I
            will never leave you comfortless.</para>
